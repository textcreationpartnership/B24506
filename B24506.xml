            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <salute>READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THat those who soberly fear God throughout the Nation may know their present interest in <hi>England,</hi> whatsoever hath been the effects of some unadvised minds but lately among the <hi>Scots,</hi> I take this for a fit season to send abroad these <hi>Sheets,</hi> while most people seem to me to become more feavourish in their Allegiance to the <hi>Higher Powers,</hi> then is allowed to them in the thirteenth to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and this Dissertation upon it. They were in the substance (excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Conclusion) prepared many years ago, and seen by many, such as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Wilkins,</hi> Judge <hi>Hales,</hi> and other the like judicious persons; and there has been several Papers since these lay by, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished and presented to the late long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb facs="tcp:206017:3"/> for removal of these injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, unto which (seeing such attempts as yet have prevailed nothing,) this Discourse comes out with the best as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance it is able, for submission. That is, so far it must be supposed only, as every man can with a safe Conscience. Those kind of <hi>Papers</hi> therefore, and this <hi>Book</hi> are indeed no enemies. The <hi>Imposition</hi> of these Laws is <hi>one</hi> thing, and the <hi>Submission</hi> to them is <hi>another.</hi> He that writes <hi>against</hi> them, and he that writes <hi>for</hi> them upon these two accounts, does but carry on the <hi>same</hi> Work. The one may propose our <hi>Difficulties</hi> as a reason for a <hi>Relaxation:</hi> the other may bring the <hi>Solution</hi> when that cannot be <hi>obtained.</hi> If any Parliament be got to <hi>release</hi> the <hi>Burden,</hi> or the <hi>Concerned</hi> be satisfied in Conscience to <hi>bear</hi> it, it comes to one. I need not say which <hi>I</hi> think best, or desire most, but the design is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eace and Moderation in both.
<pb facs="tcp:206017:3"/> The Candid will see this, some others will not see it, but accuse the Design of Contradiction. To this purpose I would have it observed, that in a few Sheets Entituled, <hi>The Peaceable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,</hi> set out by some Ministers of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> in the year 1675, when they come to offer their Arguments against the <hi>Oxford</hi> Oath, they have these Words. <hi>Which we desire may be taken with Candour in respect only to our design, that is, as Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative for the removal of these injunctions, not as peremptorily Definitive of our own judgments, and much less of others above our Sphere, in the cases concern'd in them.</hi> These are Words put in <hi>de industria</hi> to anticipate such an accusation.</p>
            <p>Nor is it the fruit of a generous Christian mind, to regard a mans self only, what <hi>I can do,</hi> how far <hi>I can go,</hi> or what is fit for <hi>me</hi> (or <hi>one</hi> party) without consideration of <hi>others.</hi> There
<pb facs="tcp:206017:4"/> are many young men in whose hearts God I hope hath sowen his Grace, that are training up at the University, and in other places, whose Parents expect they should enter the Publick Vineyard, and while their Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are limber and not grown stiff as ours are, they have need of such a Book as this is, and such a Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour to them as <hi>I</hi> am. I have writ other Papers for my <hi>self:</hi> I have writ this Book for <hi>them.</hi> That such may have the more <hi>Faith</hi> in what they act, and we the more <hi>Charity</hi> in our thoughts of them, if they do otherwise then we do. For my part, <hi>I</hi> am a debtor to those that <hi>fear God, and Conform not:</hi> and I am a debtor to those that <hi>fear God, and do Conform.</hi> Besides, if by this means <hi>I</hi> can come but to open our sore to the Publick cure, or get that case to be pondered, which I cannot by other means, I think my
<pb facs="tcp:206017:4"/> greatest purpose is not lost; I will conclude therefore with these two texts. One is, <hi>Do I perswade</hi> (that is give way to, or obey) <hi>Men or God? Or do I seek to please Man? For if I yet pleased Man, I should not be the Servant of Christ.</hi> The other is, <hi>I please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.</hi> When these <hi>Texts</hi> fall out, then shall these <hi>Things</hi> Contradict one another.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the usual infirmitie of men of the greatest parts, in their undertaking the satisfaction of Conscience in any matter of practice, which is of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to offer so many Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Considerations upon the Subject, that their strength being divided into many things, there are few of their Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Readers but see the insufficiency of what they urge, and thereby judging of the rest, they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:206017:6"/> do not know where to find the bottom which they are to set their Foot upon, and so are left unresolved in the case.</p>
               <p>There is one Famous Text therefore, I shall lay down, for the resolution of the Judgment and Conscience, in that grand matter which in this discourse is undertaken. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Let every Soul be subject to the higher Powers, for there is no Power but of God. The powers that be, are ordained of God. Whosoever therefore resisteth the Power, resisteth the Ordinance of God, and they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist shall receive to themselves Damnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From this piece of holy Writ, I will lay down my Stone, and Build upon it, That the Powers that are, that is the present Powers as they are (I suppose them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Rightful Powers) what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they be, <hi>quas tenus</hi> they be, must be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto, upon this ground, that they are the Ordinance of God, who disposes of all Powers that are, to be as they are.</p>
               <p>We must distinguish here upon necessity. There is the <hi>Power</hi> it self, and the Constitution, form, or the <hi>Qualification</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Ferne</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses it) of that Power as it is specificated in the kind, individuated in the Persons, and cloathed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:206017:6"/> with Customs and Laws in any Community or Nation. Again there is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the ordinance or <hi>ordination of Gods Precept,</hi> instituting or commanding such or such a thing in the law of Nature, or his Sacred Word: and the <hi>ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Providence,</hi> which Ruleth, Ordereth, and Disposeth the Affairs of this World, and more especially the Kingdoms and Dominions thereof according to his Council and Pleasure.</p>
               <p>This thing <hi>Power</hi> it self; that there should be an Authority in some person or persons, to Rule and Govern for the ends of Society and the common Good (without which, <hi>neither Family, nor City, nor Kingdom, nor the World it self</hi> (as <hi>Cicero, de legibus,</hi> has it) <hi>could subsist</hi>) and consequently that others should be in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to that Power, is the ordination of Gods Precept, the institution of God in the Law of Nature, and so of Moral and Everlasting obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, the very ground and reason it self of the fifth Commandment. The <hi>Constitution</hi> or <hi>Form</hi> of Government, as this power is qualified by the Laws or Customs, that are established in any place or people, according to their interests and concernments, we must know as being that which cannot be gain-said, is, and must be of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane device altogether, arising I say from mans invention, consultation, institution; and so is called a <hi>Humane creature</hi> by St. <hi>Peter,</hi>

There is now and then a line about the <hi>Venetian</hi> State in <hi>Bocaline,</hi> does touch me more to the quick, than the arguments for his <hi>Pope</hi> in <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> Nevertheless in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that differences will arise among men; and from differences dissention and division among equalls; and from division tumults, wars and ruine: for a blessed mouth hath said it, that <hi>A Nation divided cannot stand,</hi> it is very likely in my Judgment, that <hi>Monarchy</hi> came into the World as <hi>Episcopacy</hi> into the Church, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> that is <hi>Remedij loco,</hi> as the best expedient against this inconvenience, and upon that reason is preferred.</p>
               <p>Now the great question will be, how the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:206017:7"/>
                  <hi>Powers that are,</hi> which comprehend the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Government, with the person or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who are Governours, as well as the power it self under the same, are to be said the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God,</hi> which is made the ground of the precept, <hi>Be Subject.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will take here some line in speaking to this. <hi>Potestas est jus imperandi,</hi> says <hi>Arnisaeus.</hi> Take the word <hi>imperandi</hi> at large. <hi>A Right to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Dispose or Govern,</hi> say other Politicks. There is <hi>Potestas</hi> I count, that goes to the making a Commonwealth, as to the <hi>Ruling</hi> it. A right now, in or to a thing, a man cannot have, but by the grant of him that hath the propriety. The great and chief proprietor of all things is God, by creation. Upon this his Dominion is Founded. Mans Dominion arises from Gods. Dominion is either <hi>private,</hi> which is a right to have or use a thing: or <hi>publick</hi> which is to rule. Publick Dominion then or Government, which is a right to order or rule a Society of men (the principal of Gods earthly Creatures) must be derived from a grant of his, in the Original of it. This grant is an Act of his will, passed in the Law of Nature, or his Word; and this Act we call the Institution. The institution of Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy then, is Gods general Rule or Command, Grant, or Charter; which does require and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize all Communities in the World to agree
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:206017:8"/> and come together into Government, leaving them to their liberty for the framing their own constitution (consisting of the <hi>kind</hi> of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and individuation of it in the <hi>persons</hi>) as it shall conduce most to the common Good. The providence of God now comes in wholly, and disposes, orders, and determines of the minds and resolutions of the Community herein, unto this and that person as it pleases him, who is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of all his creatures, and all their actions.</p>
               <p>By this we see how Gods institution, and Gods providence do go both to the Powers that be <hi>Ordained of God:</hi> Yet must this ordination of his, in reference to the objects intended, have its distinct explication to resolve what is proposed. The <hi>Powers that are</hi> do necessarily comprehend these two things, the <hi>Power it self</hi> which denominates the Recipient, Subject, or Subjects wherein it resides to be <hi>Powers:</hi> and the <hi>Persons</hi> or <hi>subjects</hi> themselves that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated Powers, which includes the sort of Government with the same. The words, <hi>of God, ordained of God,</hi> do likewise contain two things according to their common sense in other Scriptures, to wit, <hi>Gods Decree, Counsel, or Providence,</hi> and his <hi>Law, Word, or Precept.</hi> Let us but adjust these matters now as we ought. The abstract, thing, <hi>Power</hi> it self, which in the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:206017:8"/> Nature of it is nothing but a right (<hi>a right to Govern,</hi> as was even now said) must proceed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily from that will of God which is <hi>grantive</hi> or <hi>institutive,</hi> that is, from his Law, Word or <hi>Preceptive ordination.</hi> The <hi>persons,</hi> denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Powers,</hi> together with the <hi>kind</hi> of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment included in the same, being not determined by Gods Word or Law, but left to the liberty and choice of men themselves, are of God by his decree, dispose, or <hi>Providential ordination.</hi> The Powers then that are in the Text, that is, the Powers <hi>concretively</hi> taken, are of God by his <hi>Providence,</hi> and are of God by his <hi>Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The <hi>concrete</hi> contains the <hi>abstract</hi> in it. They are of God by his institution in regard of the abstract, because the abstract thing is wholly from thence: and they are of God by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in regard of the kind of Government, and the Person. And thus far may the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Mr. <hi>Gee</hi> in his elaborate discourse of <hi>The divine Original of the Magistrate</hi> (c. 5. §. 3). take place. The thing <hi>Power</hi> it self wheresoever it resides, derives it self from Gods grant, and the Concrete hath divine warrant on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. That will answer what he brings, which though he seems to strain higher then so, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till I shall hear some Minister in stead of <hi>Charles by the Grace and Appointment of God,</hi> to say, <hi>Charles by the Law or Word of God,</hi> of <hi>England</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:206017:9"/> King, I shall be pretty sure, where his cast must be pitched. And when I have said already that the Constitution of the Government and persons governing (simply considered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) are not of God imaginably by way of institution (but for the sake of the abstract thing, Power it self), they must be the ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Providence. They are what God hath appointed, ordered, determined to be where they are, and that is the respect, I judg, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in these <hi>Humane creatures</hi> or <hi>Ordinance of man</hi> in St. <hi>Peter,</hi> are the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the ordination of God in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> upon which we see our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is Founded.</p>
               <p>It is certain that the abstract thing, <hi>Authority</hi> it self, is that alone which is of Divine necessity. Now shall a man hereupon plead thus? As for our Rulers and Laws, they are all nought, we like not any thing of the very constitution, and if we combine to endeavour the extirpation of the whole, we will not meddle with what is Sacred. That which he hath appointed is, that there should be Authority and Subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we intend in Rulers and Laws that shall be better, but as for the form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the persons Governing, and laws Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, these are humane every jot, and not at all the <hi>Ordinance</hi> of God, which we <hi>resist</hi> not. God forbid that any should presume to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:206017:9"/> argue thus, for it is not only the <hi>Power</hi> it self, but the <hi>Powers that are,</hi> whether <hi>the King as Supreme, and those sent by him,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> and the <hi>Qualification</hi> of it, which are to be submitted to by this Text, and that upon this ground, that they are the <hi>Ordinance of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no Christian goes to his prayers, but he is to pray that the will of God be done. How far this will may be extended, Christ hath taught us in that passage in his Agony, when Flesh and Bloud would willingly have had that Cup to pass, he adds, <hi>not my Will, but thy Will be done.</hi> What will was that? Not his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive will;</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> were not bound sure to put to death the Lord of Glory and shed inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent bloud: but his <hi>Decretive Will,</hi> what Gods hand had determined before permissively to be done. Let the will of Gods good providence be what it will, when man does not know it he may submit to it; and when he knows it, must not he do it? The Powers that are, as they are, are the ordinance of his decretive Will, and the Institution presupposed, that is the ground we are not to resist them (the ground of the command not to resist) upon pain of Damnation. I mean not as if the Will of God in the rightful constitution of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms were but <hi>permissive</hi> only, for so there is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:206017:10"/> no agreement of Thieves and Robbers to steal and kill, that is not by the <hi>Will</hi> of God, <hi>not hindering</hi> what they act, which yet he doth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid and punish: but I understand it as that which doth both concur effectually to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as in all acts that are good, and by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of our Subjection <hi>approves</hi> and <hi>conserves</hi> the same being done. <hi>Si ordinationis voce res intelligeretur quam Deus tantum non vult impedire quo modo se Deus habet circa vitiosos actus nulla sequeretur inde honoris obligatio, nec tantopere hanc potestatem predicaret; Sequitur ergo ut ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nata haec potestas voluntate Dei approbante intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatur.</hi> Nor will I be understood after this to exclude the universal Law of Magistracy, or institution of the Office, from Gods <hi>Ordination,</hi> for that indeed is to be presupposed to the <hi>Apostles</hi> precept. He could not bid us <hi>Be subject,</hi> if that command had not its rise and Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Nature, and so is to be fore-conceived I account, or presumed to the same.</p>
               <p>In sum, the powers that be then, are of God, by his providence, by his approbation, by his law. By his <hi>providence</hi> as I have already shewn. By his <hi>approbation,</hi> as all wholsome Laws which men do make, <hi>ut humana et humano modo,</hi> are approved of him. By his <hi>law,</hi> as there is an universal ordinance for government, from whence, a Commonwealth being framed and the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:206017:10"/> Person or Persons designed, the Power does immediatly come, and in regard of the abstract thing, Power is self being immediatly from God, the <hi>Powers</hi> in the concrete are said thus to be <hi>ordained of him.</hi> Well, to go on where I left (not excluding the second and third in the first) God does think fit the powers should be <hi>as they are,</hi> thou art discontent and wouldest endeavour to alter them; who art thou O man, that wouldst intrude inro Gods Seat? Dost thou know when thou comest to the bottom of this, what it is thou comest to? Thou wouldest be wiser than God, thou wouldest Usurp his providence, and have things otherwise. Thou wouldest indeed be God in his place.</p>
               <p>But are we here at the Root? And is this firm? There is nothing comes to pass, but it is the Will of God, and must I submit to every thing, <hi>that is,</hi> so as not to desire and endeavour it be otherwise? May I not desire and strive to remove those evils that oppress me, because Gods Will is they should fall on me? I say, no doubt of it, It is Gods Will, <hi>the Will of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,</hi> that you should have these aflictions, and suffer as you do: and it is Gods Will, <hi>the Will of his precept,</hi> that you should use the means to free your self if you can, and upon this account you act and endeavour warrantably. But if
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:206017:11"/> God bring on you any evil, and command you to bear it with that vertue as becomes that condition, and not go about to change it, for it is his will, then is the case otherwise. When the people of <hi>Judah</hi> had their City and Land ransacked by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and they were afraid of tarying in the Land, and so thought of going to <hi>Egypt,</hi> this was doing no more then the Law of self-preservation might warrant; but when God had brought on them that calamity, and commands them to stay in the Land, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these Governours that were there, and obey them, then could they not go about to fly, but they resist the Will of God, and must expect a punishment suitable to their disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Such is the case here, the governments <hi>that are,</hi> are appointed of God: There is the institution of the Office, by the universal Law of Nature always standing; there are these actual disposals of providence, making over the power to the individual persons; and such as they are therefore being once established, that ordination of God, is the ground upon which the Apostle builds this precept, <hi>Be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to them;</hi> and the precept once taking place, makes our endeavour of alteration to be evil without any more adoe. Thou shouldest apply thy self to faith, and patience, and prayers, and thou thinkest of defence, and arms, and change of thy state.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:206017:11"/>
               <p>When the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Theocracy (God raising up Judges un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him for their deliverance on all occasions) and they would needs have a King as other people, whereby they <hi>cast off God</hi> and so <hi>sinned</hi> (or else we might be tempted easily to think it no sin at all to cast off any man) <hi>Samuel</hi> tells them the <hi>Manner of their King,</hi> thus and thus he should do unto them, which was all grievous God knows: but let him do what he will, this in fine becomes their duty, they must submit to him, and nothing else can be done. Not that the doing thus and thus there menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, was lawful in a <hi>Moral</hi> sense, the King was to be accountable for the use of his power; nor that it is meant only, thus and thus he would do against <hi>Right:</hi> but thus and thus he might do in a <hi>Political</hi> sense, so that if he did, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>jus Regis</hi> of that State, they might not rise against him for it. There was no weight otherwise in his diswasive from a King; fo they might say, if the King will do as you threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, we will turn him off presently and choose another, or change our Government again at pleasure. No, they might have recourse to God, and <hi>cry unto him</hi> (as the text says) but help themselves they could not, <hi>Where the word of a King is, there is Power, and who can say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, what dost thou?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:206017:12"/>
               <p>Not but that we are to distinguish between <hi>Subjection</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> if I may use Dr. <hi>Fields</hi> words, and the sense of all Divines what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. We are not to do always whatsoever the Magistrate commands; for he may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand what is evil, and when God forbids what man requires, the greater Authority must take place of the less, according to the known deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Apostle in that case. Nevertheless we are to be in <hi>Subjection</hi> still, not disowning his Authority, but being ready to <hi>suffer</hi> his will (understanding that readiness aright) when we are not able to <hi>do</hi> it. <hi>Tum in sacris tum in profanis rebus ne{que} iubentia ne{que} vetantia precepta obligant ad agendum omittendumve ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid contra legem Dei, sive naturalem sive posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivam, sed duntaxat ad patiendum, id{que} tum demum ubi paena evitari nisi vi opposita non potest,</hi> Grotius <hi>de imperio summarum potestatum circa Sacra,</hi> p. 98.</p>
               <p>It follows not then neither, that any man from hence may set the Text of St. <hi>Paul</hi> at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance with <hi>himself,</hi> and with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and acknowledging that so long as the Magistrate is Gods Minister indeed, <hi>a terrour to those that do Evil, and a praise to those that do Well,</hi> he is to be obeyed, but when he shall do contrary, and be an encourager to vice and a terrour to the good, he is then not <hi>Gods Minister for our
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:206017:12"/> weal,</hi> and to be submitted to no longer then till we can get power to deliver our selves out of his hands. God forbid! The title of the Epistle and the time when the Apostle wrote, will be a good refutation of this conceit. The Epistle is to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the <hi>Emperour</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> was then one of the vilest <hi>Monsters</hi> upon Earth. There is the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> and there is his <hi>Acts,</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>Courses</hi> he takes. The Acts and Commands of a Magistrate, as his courses, may be such, as are not for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good: and <hi>the Laws of a Superiour which are not just and good, do not oblige the Conscience,</hi> Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> tells us <hi>Cas.</hi> l. 3. c. 1. r. 3. <hi>Quod ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessariam non habet conjunctionem cum fine publici commodi</hi> (according to <hi>Suarez) non potest praecipi lege humana.</hi> See him de legibus l. 1. c. 7. The <hi>Magistrate</hi> nevertheless, and his <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and <hi>other</hi> Laws which he <hi>conserves,</hi> are for the common good, and not to be <hi>resisted,</hi> but upheld. If <hi>Nero</hi> be Gods <hi>Minister</hi> for their good, and those governours <hi>sent by him</hi> were for the punishment of evil doers and praise of them that do well: If <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> be Gods <hi>Servant,</hi> and to be submitted to on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, then may not the wickedness of a Ruler, or the abuse of his power, priviledge us from our duty. If he does not <hi>his,</hi> yet must we do <hi>ours,</hi> and rely upon God. It appears then (as is
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:206017:13"/> suggested) there is a difference between the <hi>Magistrate</hi> and his <hi>Command,</hi> as to the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they bear. Wheresoever there is the thing <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Authority,</hi> it must, I will account, be obeyed, for <hi>Power</hi> is a ray of divine Majesty: But there is no man, the very truth of all lies there, can indeed have any power in things that are unlawful. For power being a <hi>right to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> which derives from the <hi>grant</hi> or <hi>will</hi> of the Supreme Majesty, as hath been said: and there being no <hi>will</hi> of God, or any grant of his, that any person should <hi>command that</hi> which he has <hi>forbidden,</hi> it follows directly that such a command which does so, is devoid of power, and that, <hi>that</hi> is the reason at the bottom of our <hi>Non-obedience</hi> thereunto, when <hi>subjection</hi> to the <hi>person</hi> and his <hi>Authority,</hi> is due still, by the precept of the text.</p>
               <p>I will yet distinguish, There is the end of the power, and the ends of those that are in power, <hi>Isa.</hi> 10.7. Whatsoever the ends of those who are in power be to the fulfilling their own wills, the end of the <hi>power</hi> is for the common good; and so long as that power, with the ends of it, are committed to such a person, we are conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; insomuch that when we have the courage not to <hi>obey</hi> him in evil (if he errs <hi>de fine</hi>) for <hi>wrath sake,</hi> we must have the patience to <hi>suffer</hi> in well doing for <hi>Conscience sake,</hi> and be in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:206017:13"/> still to the <hi>ordination of God. Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guendum est inter Imperij actum qui subditum ad agendum movet, &amp; vim quae patiendi aliquid ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitatem illi imponit. Cum Imperii actus effectu suo, hoc est, obligatione caret, vis tamen eo nomine illata effectum quendam habet, non tantum Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicum sed &amp; moralem, non ex parte agentis, sed ex parte patientis, hunc scilicet, ut eam vim vi re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellere non liceat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He is the Minister of God for our wealth (says the Apostle) therefore he must judg what conduces to our wealth. I know in mix'd States, as ours, the whole people, at least in their Representatives, do judg of their own weal, and so choose and preferr their Laws: yet seeing the King has a negative vote, there must be a judgment which is absolute in some kind (as is agreeable to the nature of the State) committed to him <hi>de fine &amp; mediis</hi> what is for his peoples safety, and what is for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. Which yet is to be understood in reference to the Universality, not destroying that Judgment of private discretion, which every particular man must have, as to the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and expedience of his own actions. I will shut up this with a saying of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> much made of I find, by Writers, on this Subject. I took it up last from Dr. <hi>Hakewel</hi> in his <hi>Scutum Regium. Bonos principes voto expetere debemus,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:206017:14"/> qualescun{que} pati, &amp; quomodo sterilitatem, aut ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mios imbres, &amp; caetera naturae mala, sic luxum &amp; avaritiam dominantium tolerare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You may say if here indeed be the ground of our subjection, then must many good people in the World be in a sad condition; for let their Government and Governours belike, be as evil as they will, they must bear it, and have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. God hath ordained them <hi>as they are,</hi> and if they submit not thereunto, what is it, but they will not have Gods Will to be done?

Here is one part of a disciples denying himself, and taking up his Cross; of that Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Humility, Faith, and Patience, with the like Christian Graces he is to actuate all his life. The Lord his God knows what is best for him, and such a submission, though unto death, is better for him in the everlasting Issue, then to be freed from it; or else his Father would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

               <p>Nevertheless, as for our State, God be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed our condition is not so hard in this Nation under the Powers that are, but if there be any thing that is grievous to the people, it may be altered in a way agreeable to the same. that is, by the way of Parliament, with consent of the King: So that to endeavour any alteration that way, is no resisting the ordinance of God; for Gods Ordination with us is such, as allows such an endeavour when it is needful, in the ground-work of the Land. To this purpose I observe, in the Act for preservation of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,

Let a man who is in a publick capacity, as a <hi>Clerk</hi> of the <hi>Convocation,</hi> or <hi>Member</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> offer any thing of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration (I speak as to the <hi>Administration,</hi> not <hi>Constitution</hi> of the State, which they are not to alter or dissolve) that is commodious to the Church or State, and prosecute it with vigour according to his Conscience, this is to be look'd upon, as a part of <hi>Subjection,</hi> which <hi>the Powers that are</hi> do require of him in his place, not any <hi>resistance</hi> of it. But let a man who is only in a private capacity go about to make any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is, in a way not allowed by <hi>the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers that are</hi> (whereas if it be in a way appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he may be reckoned to act in a capacity <hi>political,</hi> though a <hi>private person</hi>) this mans en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour is a <hi>resisting Gods Ordinance</hi> in the most intimate sense that the thing does import.

               <p>Having purposed here the end of this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a rub stays me, There are some very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, may be apt to think, that those persons who have a title to the Government in any Land according to the constitution thereof, have more then providence to plead for their being <hi>the Powers ordained of God</hi> in the Text of the Apostle, and so may find fault with something here that is passed. I answer, If any Ruler have indeed <hi>more</hi> to plead for his being <hi>of God</hi> then
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:206017:16"/> providence, then hath he <hi>providence</hi> to plead for it, and what I have sa d on that score, will do him no hurt: Nevertheless the constitution it self, and so the <hi>title</hi> any have according to that constitution, and the <hi>persons</hi> to whom the Government belongs according to that title, are <hi>of God,</hi> we are to know really, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, then by his <hi>providence,</hi> which hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and disposed the hearts of men to agree so, that according to such a constitution, such a person, should have such a title, and so being designed for the Government there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but the <hi>institution of the Office</hi> with it, that goes to the making him the power <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained</hi> of him.</p>
               <p>That there should be some to bear the Sword for the punishment of Vice, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of Virtue; or that some should be the Ministers of God for the common good, which is that I call the power <hi>in the abstract</hi> (that is abstracted from the <hi>Qualification</hi> put on it by the constitution) is the Precept of God expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Apostle, and in the light of Nature, and so of divine institution: But what the <hi>person</hi> or persons shall be who bear the Sword, what the <hi>form</hi> of Government, what the <hi>consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> what that which shall give title accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it, what the terms upon which the Government must be held, and the several
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:206017:16"/> particular customs and laws which are conveni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ent to be observed, according to the diversity of place and Nation, These are all (if they may be called all, which come in effect into one, to wit, <hi>the Qualification of the Power,</hi> as I call it otherwhere) left to the liberty of man: and to go about the thinking out any other <hi>Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God,</hi> then this of his Wisdom and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in these things, will quit no cost, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it cannot put any barre to the <hi>Ʋsurper,</hi> nor bring any more advantage to the <hi>rightful Governour</hi> then this does. For how shall that man who usurps the Government plead any title from providence, when it is the <hi>Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods Providence</hi> in the Nation, which is directly contrary to his claim? <hi>The Act of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, productive of Civil power, is that, which disposeth of the right and title, and not of the meer possession,</hi> says Mr. <hi>Gee</hi> herein very well, p. 129. And which security is greater to the Prince, to make a <hi>resisting</hi> of him to be a resisting of Gods <hi>Precept</hi> only, or to be a resisting Gods <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> also, a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and entring Gods Throne? Nevertheless, in regard that there are few or no Dominions Hereditary, but there will now and then step up one out of his rank, and it is very dangerous to make the people judges of their Princes titles; and in regard that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God and Nature for Government it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:206017:17"/> self, or the necessity thereof in general, is so far to be prefered before the singular interest of any person or persons therein concerned, there is a determination to be attributed to <hi>Providence over-ruling the Title</hi> in some case; which, if I may deliver my opinion, in short will come to this, that though no person, <hi>as to himself,</hi> does become the Power <hi>ordained</hi> in the Text meerly for his <hi>possession,</hi> yet does he become so <hi>to us</hi> upon his <hi>reception,</hi> and good Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration.</p>
               <p>I distinguish here, between the part of the Usurper, and the Subject; Between the Usurpation, and Gods Providence ordering and disposing the wills and consent of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to his admission. The occupant, I judg, cannot hold what he has got, with a good conscience toward God and his Neighbour whom he hath wronged, but he is bound to restore it to him that hath the right Title: yet I think (I say) when Providence hath preclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him from any possibility of returning to enjoy it, and hath enclined the hearts of the generality to a dedition, the <hi>particular Subject</hi> for his part is concluded in point of Subjection. And this I suppose our Law does favour, which will own the wholsome Statutes of a <hi>Richard</hi> the 3d. or <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th. as of an <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the 2d. and <hi>Richard</hi> the 1st. And if it were
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:206017:17"/> not so, then might the thirteenth to the <hi>Romans</hi> for several if not the most part of our Kings, from the <hi>Conquerour</hi> to <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, be laid by, and signifie nothing, and we to reckon no <hi>higher Powers</hi> during their Reigns, <hi>ordained of God in our</hi> Nation.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> The Ground upon which all Lawfulness for any People to endeavour the change of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when it proves grievous to them is Founded, rendered insufficient and dissolute to our State.</head>
               <p>NOt that we live without Intelligence from daily History of the lubricity and common mutations of this World, both as to persons and States or Kingdoms; Nor can it be hid from the considerate how deep a root and footing there is in Politicks for the same; which do receive a diverse Measure and Judgment according to the condition of Time, Place, Person and Constitution, where they are made. There is no Authority (it is pleaded) one man could have over another, who by Nature are equall, but he must <hi>Cedere de jure suo,</hi> and let him have it by consent: so that all Power Originally
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:206017:18"/> was given to their Rulers by the people, and to the common good, and if they use it therefore to their hurt, they may take it away again.</p>
               <p>For demolishing those strong Towers of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Insurrection, which have been, or may be built on this Foundation, I am not Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the more ancient device, promoted afresh by a late great name, that would do it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, if the difficulty of that way were not so apparent and inextricable as a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide by it, and that is, by deriving all Government from <hi>Paternity</hi> or <hi>Genarchy.</hi> But besides that, a man can hardly be content to have that made the Basis and proper Title to Magistracy, as will leave us never a Magistrate of the right Stamp in the Universal World, since <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons deceased: It is manifest, as Authors do distinguish their <hi>Oeconomicks</hi> and <hi>Politicks,</hi> so is the Power of a <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Magistrate</hi> really different, in the <hi>kind,</hi> and <hi>foundation</hi> of the Relation; the one being of <hi>Choice,</hi> the other of <hi>Nature. Quasi vero nihil intersit inter magnam domum, &amp; parvam civita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> says <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his <hi>Pol.</hi> l. 1. at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. Over a Multitude (says <hi>Hooker</hi> Ec. <hi>Pol.</hi> l. 1. §. 10.) <hi>consisting of many Families ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no dependency on one, as the Family or the Father, impossible it is that any should have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat lawful Power but by consent, of men, or imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:206017:18"/> appointment of God.</hi> These words (though but a few of many) are directions enough in this point. <hi>I am perswaded</hi> (says a sober Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for Monarchy, in the late distractions) <hi>it will appear an uncontrollable truth in Policy, that the consent of the people, either by themselves or Ancestors, is the only mean in ordinary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, by which Sovereignty is conferred on a person or family.</hi> It is not for me therefore, to go here against the Stream of so much light. I must acknowledg that a <hi>Community</hi> of men are not a <hi>Herd,</hi> to be <hi>driven</hi> into Government; but as subjection is a <hi>Moral</hi> act, and they <hi>free</hi> agents, they do come into the same by <hi>agreement,</hi> and that through a kind of <hi>Potestative</hi> act, as I am apt to conceive of it, unto which, as they are commanded, they must be Authorized by the <hi>Will</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>We must know therefore, where there is a Company of Persons and Families in a Vicinity fitted for receiving a form of Government not yet introduced, this is called a <hi>Community;</hi> who though they have a <hi>propriety</hi> of what they possess, and <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>person,</hi> and consequently an <hi>equality</hi> in respect of one another, yet is there, according to Nature, a Superiority in the <hi>Ʋniversal</hi> over each <hi>Singular</hi> person; that the giving place of all <hi>distributively,</hi> to the good of all <hi>collectively,</hi> is not free <hi>in soro interiori,</hi> in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:206017:19"/> regard of Conscience, when it is free from any, <hi>in foro exteriori,</hi> in regard of Compulsion. It is a question whether a Community (as just now defined) be obliged to enter Society for the common end of Government, or no? That is, whether <hi>Sponte adducti,</hi> or <hi>Dei praecepto</hi> they do <hi>coire</hi> into a <hi>Commonwealth?</hi> I see what has passed from <hi>Grotius,</hi> but if it be not a duty from the light of Nature (which is Gods precept) then is not a Commonwealth from Nature (which the <hi>Bees</hi> teach us) and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from divine institution, when yet the Text tells us, it is the <hi>Ordinance of God.</hi> If it be, then must the same Law of Nature, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires men to enter Societies, require that some should <hi>follow,</hi> and some <hi>lead</hi> in the doing. Those that lead are the prevalent part, whether by Wisdom, Riches, Valour, Goodness, or bare Majority. The providence of God that designs the persons in all Governments, designs these to the leading the rest unto Government. These act as they represent the Universal, and in that name they have right. Now a <hi>right to lead</hi> from God is <hi>Potestas.</hi> There may be Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testas (as <hi>potestas ordinis</hi>) which is not <hi>coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive.</hi> This power in the Community is not to all purposes, but to this purpose. It is their Office to consider and determine what Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is best for them, and so to frame their
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:206017:19"/> constitution and appoint their Governour. If they have not Authority from God to do this, how comes the constitution to be binding to Posterity, and have the preheminence over all the Laws that succeed? If no <hi>Law</hi> can be made but by Authority, can a <hi>Constitution</hi> be made without any? A right to frame the Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to <hi>bind</hi> others, must be Power. If the least Law be from a higher Power, the greatest must be the highest; and <hi>Maxima potestas</hi> is <hi>Sovereignty.</hi> What then can be more ingenuous upon this, when in a Community, <hi>as a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> there are no persons yet chosen in whom the Power shall reside, to distinguish with <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soldus</hi> and other Politicks in this manner. There is <hi>Majestas duplex, realis</hi> and <hi>personalis. Real</hi> Sovereignty is in the <hi>Community</hi> for the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting a Commonwealth, <hi>Personal</hi> in the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate</hi> to administer it.</p>
               <p>Suppose a company of Families together un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no mans jurisdiction. Frame we our Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. What are these people here to do? The Natural answer I think is, they are to do what is best for them. There are some of them think it best for them to remain Independent, but if it be not best for the generality to enter Society, <hi>Society</hi> shall not be of <hi>Nature,</hi> for therefore it is of God and Nature because it is best. Here the first thing that appears in Policy,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:206017:20"/> is this, that there is a <hi>Good</hi> arising from their being or living together, unto which they all of them have right. If Society be not best to some of them, as they think, in regard of their particular interest, there does appear next a right in the <hi>Ʋniversal</hi> that must take place of that right in the <hi>Singulars,</hi> as to the aforesaid <hi>good.</hi> This <hi>good</hi> however lies in the mutual help and assistance which by God they are bound, and able, to yield one another, if they do their Duty. To fetch this <hi>good</hi> out it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary they agree to an <hi>order</hi> of <hi>Superiority</hi> and <hi>Inferiority</hi> (which is a <hi>Commonwealth</hi>) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in some may be appointed to see that men do this duty by compelling the refractory, and encouraging the willing, that the <hi>good</hi> be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, which they as a <hi>Community,</hi> while the Families are equal, are not capable to do. <hi>And these are Gods Ministers</hi> (says the Apostle) <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending continually upon this very thing.</hi> Here then appears these two Powers, the <hi>real</hi> and the <hi>personal;</hi> a Power to <hi>constitute a Governour,</hi> and a Power to <hi>Govern.</hi> The right vnto the <hi>good,</hi> which is the end of the Government and Governour, belongs not to any one, but to every one, not to the Governour, but Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, and to him as one of them only. The Sovereignty then radically is in the <hi>Community,</hi> but the life and activity of it cannot be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:206017:20"/> but by a <hi>personal</hi> Sovereign, whose power begins where theirs stops, to the attainment <hi>of the same very thing</hi> in their behalf for them. There is power therefore in the Community to its proper purpose, and there is power in the Governour. The power of the Community is not <hi>Governing</hi> as the Magistrates is, and the Governours power is not to <hi>make the</hi> Constitution, as is that of the Community. These powers mingle not, nor hurt one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
               <p>The <hi>jura Regalia</hi> or <hi>prerogatives indicate</hi> a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign; The prime <hi>Regalia</hi> are making Laws, and constituting Officers: the Community makes the constitution &amp; constitutes the Governour. Is not that real Sovereignty? The Universality is the end of the commonwealth, the <hi>finis cui</hi> for whose good it is framed, and the efficient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God that frames it, and in this respect it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a humane creature; what title then can be attributed less hereunto then <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty</hi> on that account? Suppose me in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity where I have propriety of Goods and Liberty of Person, Does not the law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bind me to consent to my own loss in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular for the benefit of the many? <hi>Charity</hi> I know barely, requires me not <hi>to mind my own things</hi> onely, but the <hi>things of others,</hi> but doth Charity bind me to <hi>prefer</hi> other mens? Charity
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:206017:21"/> begins at home, and requires me to love my Neighbour <hi>as my self,</hi> not <hi>above</hi> my self, and how then could this really be, unless the <hi>Ʋniversi</hi> did virtually <hi>&amp; eminenter praeesse singulis,</hi> and the <hi>singuli a Deo &amp; Natura universis subderentur?</hi> In the <hi>collective body</hi> (says <hi>Hooker) that hath not derived as yet the principality of power into some one, or few, the whole of necessity must be head over each part, otherwise it could not have power possibly to make any one certain head; inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the power of making a head, belongeth unto head-ship.</hi> If there be not <hi>potestas</hi> in the Community, then is the constitution of a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no <hi>Law,</hi> the grand Law, the very Law of the Land no Law, which methinks is ill. If it be not Law before, but made so by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces subsequent act, then may he by a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign act reverse it again, which will be worse. If it be no <hi>Law,</hi> then it is a <hi>Covenant,</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,</hi> but how shall that be a <hi>Contract</hi> which is made by <hi>one party,</hi> to wit, the Community a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Sovereign, while yet they have none? Nay what if the constitution be to have their Sovereign by Vote or Lot, how shall that be a <hi>contract</hi> between the Sovereign and Subject, when the Sovereign is not yet chose? A <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,</hi> I think farther, binds not a Successour, but by virtue of its being <hi>Law.</hi> And that which is yet worst to the main business, if one party
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:206017:21"/> breaks a meer Covenant, the other is disobli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
               <p>After this unto the great Plea in hand, I shall put in my doubt, and answer.</p>
               <p>I doubt here, that those golden days which Writers of Politicks have Fancied in all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, supposing them to have Model'd their own Government (as a body at first without a form) and chose their Governours according to it, may deceive us: seeing the first Lords and Rulers of the Earth (as <hi>Nimrod</hi>) got their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions by violence, and the people we may conceive after obtained such exemptions and liberties they could from them, in their <hi>Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</hi> Let us distinguish therefore between these two questions, what is <hi>de jure</hi> in Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and what <hi>hath been,</hi> or is <hi>de facto?</hi> We discourse ordinarily on this Subject, and I think ought to do, as we conceive of things <hi>de jure,</hi> when if we enquire thereof strictly <hi>de facto,</hi> we shall find some little matter that is near or like to what our Politicians do write, and that is virtually to go for the same. The more solemn though, a Government is in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and the nearer to such principles it comes, the more desirable is it by man, and the more approved by God. In that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therefore wherein God hath been him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self an Author to us in Politicks (who knows
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:206017:22"/> the best Rules to go by) when the people would have a King, and set up another Government, he directs this course. <hi>Samuel</hi> is to tell them first the <hi>Manner</hi> of their <hi>King,</hi> or <hi>Kingdom</hi> (so it is express'd in two places) that is, the <hi>Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Government,</hi> unto which they <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> and then is their King introduced, and this constitution wrote in a Book, and laid up before the Lord. There is but a resemblance of this happily in the constitution of most King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms in the World, yet is the <hi>agreement</hi> of the people <hi>mediate</hi> or <hi>immediate, tacite</hi> or <hi>express,</hi> so necessary, that a people who are <hi>Conquered</hi> cannot be <hi>Governed</hi> as men by the Victor, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their consent; and his Victory tends only to give him a right by inducing them to a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> which being done upon saving their lives, his grace and protection, there remains some shaddow yet of a <hi>Constitution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer then, if the supposition were true, that the power of the Ruler was given by the people, as well as their consent is required to it, and it came indeed Originally from them, then were the consequence perhaps not irrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal. But our Text tells us otherwise, <hi>The Powers that be, are ordained of God.</hi> Let me understand my own answer. If when a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity set up Government and made them a Ruler, they were at their own liberty, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:206017:22"/> might choose whether they would or no, so that the <hi>Will</hi> alone of the people was the Original of the Rulers Power, and that be a Foundation to bear it, then would this double consequence I take it be good. The one, that They who were willing before to have such a one for their Governour, to the end of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that is, for the common good, and he abuses his Authority to their hurt, must needs be willing no longer; for, the End which was the reason of their <hi>Will</hi> failing, their <hi>Will</hi> must cease also. The other is, that they ceasing to be willing, and their Will being the prime cause and fountain of the Power, the Cause ceasing, the Power, which is the Effect, must cease with it. But the matter is not indeed so, There are no people I apprehend are at their own liberty, but under the command of God to enter Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and yield to government for his glory; so that it is not the <hi>Will of the people</hi> but the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign <hi>Will</hi> of Almighty <hi>God</hi> that is the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Power, and can be alone a Basis suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for it. For Dominion being founded in propriety, and God alone being the proper Lord of his creatures (as hath been expressed in the former chapter) there is no mortal can have right to use, or rule over, any of them, but by a grant of his. This grant, I have said farther, does lie in an Act of his Will, which
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:206017:23"/> is passed in his Word, and the light of Nature. I add now, this Note. Government in the Ruler may be look'd upon as his <hi>Office</hi> and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and so this <hi>Act</hi> of Gods <hi>Will</hi> may be called his <hi>Precept;</hi> or as a Right and <hi>Dignity,</hi> and so it is to be styled a <hi>Grant</hi> or Commission: But whether you call it one or the other name, this <hi>Will</hi> of God is the thing from whence all Power in the World is derived and owed. It follows not therefore that when a Governour abuses his Power, and the people cease their consent, that his Authority ceases: because the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which is not received without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, does not depend upon that consent as the cause and root of it, but on the standing Will of God.</p>
               <p>I will borrow a Simile from a late Writer, whereby he would shew how the <hi>Ministerial</hi> power does not flow from man in <hi>Orders,</hi> but immediately from Christ. It is applicable as well here. In Cities or Corporate Towns they have a Charter, which does allow them to choose such or such a person, to swear him, and perform such ceremonies; but when these things are done as appointed, the Power or Authority he hath to be <hi>Mayor</hi> for that year, flows imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from the Charter, or grant of the King. Thus it is with the Supreme Power, in reference to its Original. There is an institution or Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:206017:23"/> from God, writ in the Law of Nature and the Word, that there shall be Authority in some, and Subjection in others, which allows men liberty to form what Government is best for them: but when the Constitution is made, and the designation of the person or persons to govern according to that constitution, the power of the Supremacy flows immediately not from that Constitution, Election, Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (though by the Constitution it is <hi>qualified</hi> 'tis true,) but from that <hi>Charter</hi> which is <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</hi> And that this is indeed so, it may appear from those titles God takes of <hi>King of Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord of Lords. By me Kings reign,</hi> and the like. That is, a Universal Sovereignty is attributed to him, <hi>of whom the whole Family in Earth and Heaven is named;</hi> so that as there is no Subject can have any Rule in a Land (as in the instance before mentioned) but he must derive it from the King or the Supreme there: so is there no King or Potentate in the Earth can hold his Supreme Authority over any one single Nation, but he must hold it both <hi>from</hi> and <hi>under</hi> him who is the Sovereign of the World. And hence it is that Gods representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they bear, <hi>I have said, ye are Gods,</hi> and it is recorded, <hi>They worshipped God, and their King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You may say what does this inferr, The
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:206017:24"/> Power of the Magistrate which is Temporary, or Pactionary, is from God and <hi>immediately,</hi> as much as that of any Hereditary absolute Prince, Does it follow therefore that his Power cannot be taken away again? I answer, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that it cannot be taken away but on the terms it was received. If a Government be <hi>Pactionary,</hi> and the Magistrate breaks with the people, it is true that he must forfeit notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his Power is immediately from God: But if it be not so, the deriving the Power from God immediately, does render it invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable from that consent that was yet at first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to its possession. The reason of both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, because the Power passes from God with the Qualification it hath put on it by man in the Constitution, if that hath rendered it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, so God will have it to pass: if there be no such Qualification put on it thereby at the passing, it once being passed, cannot be revoked by man to be qualified otherwise, because it is not from him that it comes.</p>
               <p>Unto Government there goes something of <hi>Divine</hi> and something of <hi>Humane</hi> institution. That which is Divine flows from God <hi>immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> that which is Humane <hi>mediately.</hi> To flow im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from God is to flow so from him as that nothing comes as a <hi>cause</hi> between his Will and the Effect. To flow from him mediately
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:206017:24"/> is when there are second causes concurr to the same. The <hi>Quailfication</hi> of all Government is from God <hi>mediately,</hi> because he hath referred that to mans liberty for good reasons regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humane Nature and consent, and the will of man comes between God and it, so that, that is immediately according to Mans will, and mediately according to Gods. But the <hi>Power it self</hi> is from God <hi>immediateiy,</hi> because there is nothing comes between the grant or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and the right, as any <hi>cause</hi> of it else; there is only a disposition of the Subject, which being put, the <hi>form</hi> flows as into the <hi>matter</hi> immediately from that Will. From whomso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the <hi>form</hi> of any Government and the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of the Power according to that form does arise, the <hi>Power</hi> it self comes from <hi>above. Aliud est imperium</hi> (says <hi>Grotius) aliud haben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di modus.</hi> Power in the Community is <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> or belongs to the universal over the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars <hi>without Concession.</hi> Power personal in Commonwealths orderly framed is <hi>Convention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> upon consent, but that consent comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween only as <hi>Conditio,</hi> that is, <hi>Causa sine qua non</hi> (the Constitution must first be framed) but it concurrs not <hi>per modum causae efficaciter ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantis,</hi> to conferr or give the same. It is <hi>Gods</hi> Will, not <hi>Mans</hi> does that. They are <hi>Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi> says the Text. <hi>You could have no Power unless it were given you of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:206017:25"/>
               <p>You may say if there be a real Sovereignty in the people, and they may choose what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth they please, and have what Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Governour they please; and he shall have no more Power, nor no otherwise then they allow and appoint, nay and he shall keep his Power no longer, and be lyable to be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of Power for mal-administration, if they at first so agree (all which is certain in their liberty only to frame their own Constitution): how shall we deny but the people give the Power, or how shall we say he derives the same from God? I answer, In the first place, when I call that <hi>right</hi> in the Community to frame their Constitution <hi>real Sovereignty,</hi> this expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion makes nor marrs any thing as to the main business, only in regard the <hi>Constitution</hi> is the highest <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Legislation</hi> is the chief Right of Majesty, and the Community have that right from God to make their Constitution, here is that thing I count certainly which <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty</hi> is, and to give it that name hereupon that others have done, will, I hope, offend no body: But as for the substance of the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is forelaid and prevented already. There is the <hi>Power</hi> it self, and the <hi>Qualification</hi> of it. The qualification, ordering, or disposition of the Power in what form of Government or Governours, as it may conduce best to the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:206017:25"/> end appointed of God, that is, the Common good, is left to the liberty of man, and so is immediately from him, or as he appoints, but the Power it self, I say, is immediately from God. I have likewise presented you my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing hereof. There is one and the same Charter or Institution of God in Nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he commands or wills a double Power, in a double Subject, and as two distinct rights in those two Subjects, the one is a right or Power to <hi>constitute</hi> a Commonwealth, the other is to <hi>Govern</hi> it. The <hi>Constitution</hi> is one thing, the <hi>Administration</hi> another. To argue that the Power of the Community is not such a Power as the personal Sovereign's is, which is coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive, therefore there is no <hi>Potestas</hi> in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, is all one as to say, there is no Power in the Prince to make the Constitution, and that being the highest point of Law-making, and Legislation makes a Sovereign, <hi>Ergo,</hi> he has not <hi>Maximam Potestatem,</hi> which is Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, These are two <hi>rights</hi> then distinct, yet as they agree <hi>sub eodem genere</hi> and are both <hi>Power,</hi> they equally flow from the same insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of God. God <hi>wills</hi> that a Community should frame their constitution, this gives them <hi>right</hi> to do it; A right of making any law or laws to bind others (even the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and governed) is not Power only, I
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:206017:26"/> take it, but <hi>Sovereign</hi> Power. It is Gods will also, that according to the Constitution made, a Commonwealth should be <hi>Defended</hi> from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, by making Warand Peace: and <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> in making Lawsand Officers for the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration, and <hi>doing Justice</hi> to the Subjects, in rewards and punishments. <hi>This</hi> gives the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour his <hi>right,</hi> and from <hi>thence</hi> he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive it. It is true also that the Constitution puts an extension or limits upon these <hi>rights</hi> of the Governour according to the consent of the Community, because it is Gods Will also it should be so, that no man may <hi>lift up himself above his Bretheren</hi> but for their <hi>good:</hi> Yet is the <hi>Power</hi> in the abstract (when the <hi>Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> thereof, I say still, is from man) only and immediately from God. I will renew the Simile before. Suppose a Prince should grant a Charter to any City not only to choose them a Magistrate which he hath appointed, but to appoint what Magistrate they please for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to prescribe Laws and Rules for him to Act by, and that they may choose him abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely for his time, or conditionally, and upon his Misdemeanour actually depose him, and then being in <hi>statu quo,</hi> constitute another kind of Governour, and other rules which they judg better, holding still under the King, who is there will not say this is <hi>Authority?</hi> and yet if
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:206017:26"/> they do not put him down, or choose him conditionally, the <hi>jus</hi> or right from the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (seeing they might if they would) is the same thing. If they shall choose him <hi>absolutely,</hi> and he break their Rules and his own Engagements, they may repent they chose him not <hi>conditionally</hi> at first, and they may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to the King, they may <hi>cry to him,</hi> and he may punish him or remove him, but they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>cannot,</hi> the remedy now is out of their hands. The reason is (what has been given) because that neither the Power by which they acted in constituting of him was their own, nor that Power he received upon that constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, theirs, but both of them derived to them from that Charter of the King. I need make no application, only I would here shew that there is <hi>Potestas</hi> in a Community, and that this <hi>Potestas,</hi> when a Government is absolute, can do the Governour no hurt. In Marriage the consent of the Man and the Woman makes the Husband and Wife, but their consent will not dissolve the Marriage again, because the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity the Husband has over the Wife, flows not from that consent, but from the Law and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of God. So may there be in some Commonwealths a consent of the people pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to them, that is, necessary to their making the Supreme Magistrate, but the authority
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:206017:27"/> flowing from God and not them, it is not in their power to reverse what they have done. Provided though, it be not fore-agreed to the contrary in the fundamental coagulation of any State, for when the <hi>imperium ipsum</hi> is <hi>aliunde,</hi> the <hi>modus habendi</hi> must follow that agreement. Indeed if a Marriage-contract be broken, and a Woman become an Adulteress, the Man may withdraw his consent and put her away: when if the Prince who is absolute break his promise, the people cannot depose him for all that. The reason I would assign is, because that Marriage is in the nature of a <hi>Contract</hi> only, and so one party breaking it, the other is loosed: but the constitution of a Land which makes the Prince and Subject, is a <hi>Law,</hi> and if one person neglect to perform his duty which a <hi>Law</hi> requires of him, that does not priviledge another under the same to do so also.</p>
               <p>Whither this drives then, you may begin now to conjecture. You are ready to say per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, But is not this notion of Real Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Community, that, <hi>that</hi> should be Law which they at first agree and conclude upon, something dangerous to <hi>Anointed</hi> Majesty? And why do you not fall in with those that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it, rather then with <hi>Hooker</hi> and the Stream that runs ordinarily in the sense or purport of it? I answer, you may judg by the sequel as
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:206017:27"/> to the one, and I will offer you a reason why, as to the other. I do apprehend by some oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition which is made against this notion (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is little fear of what was done so many hundred or thousand years ago) that those who leave the light and benefit of this, must receive other notions, which if they be not more dangerous to Government, they are more irrefragably destructive to the Doctrine here undertaken. The <hi>Constitution</hi> is that which <hi>makes</hi> the King, <hi>Lex facit Regem</hi> say the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers. What Law? not that Law which <hi>he</hi> makes, for that cannot make him, that was made by him, but the fundamental Law, or Laws of the Constitution, and the Law in our Books, as <hi>declarative</hi> of that. Now if the Constitution of a Nation do not proceed from <hi>Power</hi> in the Community, that is, from such an authority from God, given at first to them for this purpose, as shall be obligatory as a Law, then must it have the virtue of a <hi>Contract</hi> only, which must be supposed originally to be made between the people not yet Subjects, but free, and the Sovereign; And then whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever rights are found to be exempted in the fundamental Laws of this Contract from the Princes power, they must be kept inviolable to the people, or else the Constitution is dissolv'd, and they shall be free from their Allegiance.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:206017:28"/> Thus shall the <hi>Cause</hi> in the late Wars, and those of the <hi>Barons</hi> be full Stated. Thus can there no right orderly framed Government in the Earth, be an <hi>absolute</hi> Government. Thus must there be no fundamental liberties of the people of this Land, or of one, above others, but the King must be Pactionary, and the Prince no absolute Prince. Thus the Parliament representing the people as Trustees to secure their liberties up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the violation of any of them, shall be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied if they raise a new Warr to our endless confusion. But if we make the <hi>Constitution</hi> of a Land an Act of the highest Sovereignty (which we call <hi>real,</hi> as virtually being such) that being Authorized by God, does therefore become the <hi>standing Law</hi> to Posterity, (as the ancient <hi>Land-marks set by the Elders,</hi>) never to be removed, then must the Power which is absolutely derived on any person and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, continue inviolable against this assault, which is the strongest I suppose that can be made at any time for Rebellion. For seeing it pleased Almighty God at first to leave the <hi>Real</hi> Sovereign (who goes down I will account when the <hi>Personal</hi> ariscs, leaving us but one Sun in our State at once) at perfect liberty to its proper Power (to wit the Qualification of the Government) so that the Community might make what Laws for the Constitution they
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:206017:28"/> pleased, and put a condition on them if they would, to wit that if the Prince broke them, or any of them, he should forfeit and loose his Dignity, but they thought best that their Prince should be absolute and his Oath only taken, leaving him, if he break it, to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty: this Constitution being made, and the Power flowing to him from God immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately with no other qualifications then is put on it by the Costitution, it must remain irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokeable, against all future contradiction. I am therefore very little offended with the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litica</hi> of Mr. <hi>Lawson,</hi> that dexterous person in this sort of Learning, whose book considering the time it came out, both for its Light into Civil Government, and his peculiar notion of Ecclesiastical, as Nationally Independent, whereby in his capacity he strewed the way at that season, for return of King and Bishop, is not to be envied its due praise, and cautious use to be made of it.</p>
               <p>There is a question or two, you may yet ask me. The Power of a Commonwealth lies in its Sovereign; The Commonwealth virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally is in the Community, The Power conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently must virtually be there also; Yet is not the Power of the Sovereign the same with the Communities, yea, nor conferred by it, but <hi>given of God.</hi> How will you make these agree?
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:206017:29"/> How is it then? <hi>Ans.</hi> Why thus. All Power is from above, That which is <hi>from above,</hi> is Gods <hi>Will,</hi> a grant, passed in the divine Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Man. The grant is not to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign but to the Community: The Charter in the Simile before, is the <hi>Cities</hi> Charter not the <hi>Mayors.</hi> If there be something granted then to the Community that the Sovereign has not, and to the Sovereign, that which the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is not capable of, then is there <hi>distinct Powers;</hi> And the Powers being so, it appears that, although what is done by the Community in order to the Power of the personal Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign be acts of a preceding Power in them, <hi>that</hi> power of theirs does not make them Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours or intermediate causes of the personal Power, because his and theirs doth both flow, as hath been said, from the same <hi>grant.</hi> Indeed they are causes of the qualification (as is incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated) which comprizes the <hi>Manner</hi> of their Kingdom with the particular person or persons Reigning, and upon that account are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple said truly to <hi>make their King,</hi> but as for the Power it self (the qualification being put) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is able to come between it and God. <hi>De Regum authoritate, quod ex jure Divino non sit, quod immediate a Deo non descendat—sed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diante corpore collectivo— Tortus probat; Asse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri enim Scriptorum sententia communi—De reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no

               <p>One thing more and that is the last. But what if a man cannot distinguish between the <hi>Concrete</hi> and the <hi>Abstract,</hi> the Qualification and the Power, and so holds only in grosse that God is the prime Cause, and Men the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Causes or Instruments (which is a Cause) of the <hi>Power</hi> of the Magistrate. Suppose their conceptions thus. <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Power (says <hi>Christ</hi>) was given him of God, yet did he hold it by Commission from <hi>Caesar.</hi> Gods Will is, that <hi>Caesar</hi> should be <hi>Emperour, Caesar</hi>'s Will is, that <hi>Pilate</hi> should be Governour of the <hi>Jews;</hi> Thus <hi>Pilate</hi> hath his Power from God. Real Sovereignty in a Community is Native and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate from God; The personal Sovereign is constituted by the Community; Under Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers by the Prince; Thus all Power is of God. It may be ask'd then, What prejudice is it, would come to our Cause in hand by this? I answer, I think the Nail is driven closer by more blows, but if it have no more. I suppose it will, hold so long only as we resolve Civil Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer into the Will Institutive of God, and not
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:206017:30"/> into the Will of Man. Indeed we cannot (I think) do that cleerly but by this distinction, something being left to Mans Will in it, and something not; but if any list to confound them, and hold the same thing more confusedly, or to disprove this, and be contentious, I am no Dogmatical Opinatour in my conceptions. There is this benefit (I will add rather) may arise upon their supposition, that the Original of Magistracy will lie more easy for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon understanding then it does. Civil Power hereby shall be <hi>Potestas a naturali Orta,</hi> though not <hi>Naturalis;</hi> Neither shall there need be for any in the deriving the Power of a Prince from God to Sweat so much as to make him a pedigree from <hi>Noah,</hi> that holds only the Community have <hi>Potestatem</hi> in what they do. God empowers the Community to make the Constitution; The Constitution empowers (they may say, designs I say) the Magistrate; Thus the Power is of God. <hi>Deus Author, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulus instrumentum</hi> says <hi>Barclay.

               <p>IT must be known, if it be not already, that the person, or persons, in whom the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme authority does reside (let it be where it will) has an Absolute and Universal power supposed to them by the Word of God, which if it receive any restraint or limitation, it is from the Constitution, Laws, or original Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment only of the Nation where they are. This must be understood rightly, not in <hi>materiâ In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitâ</hi> (for <hi>Kings by Conquest that make their own Charter</hi> (or own Terms) <hi>are set in the line of the Law of God and Nature,</hi> says <hi>Hooker</hi>) but <hi>in materia Politica.</hi> And indeed that is so necessary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n the nature of the thing, that we cannot conceive a Power Supreme unto whom no man can say <hi>What doest thou?</hi> that is, which is unaccountable to any other, but it must be free and unlimited. Not but the <hi>Office</hi> is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited (to use Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi>'s words), the Prince hath his duty set him as well as we, and the <hi>Laws of God</hi> oblige him equally, and that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:206017:32"/> from the penalty (he being alike obnoxious to it) as the meanest person; but the <hi>Power</hi> is unlimited (says he) that is any otherwise then by his duty, and the <hi>Laws which are Civil</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not oblige him from (or through) the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but upon the account of Ingenuity and Equity. <hi>Licet non teneatur ipsius legis vi coacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va, tenetur vi tamen quadam directiva; Ratio si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quidem naturalis dictat Principem legem istam servare quam is tulerit,</hi> says <hi>Coveruvias.</hi> To this agrees <hi>Suarez De Legibus</hi> l. 3 c. <hi>ult.</hi> And, <hi>Quae ex jure naturae dependent ijs princeps etiam tenetur, quia licet sit Dominus aliorum, subditus tamen est Naturae &amp; civis Mundanus,</hi> is solid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spoken by <hi>Arnisaeus De Jur. Ma.</hi> l. 1. c. 3.</p>
               <p>The Power is <hi>unlimited,</hi> I say, as to the word of God (Take it in its <hi>Proper matter,</hi> and that <hi>Negatively,</hi> not <hi>Possitively,</hi> for Christianity in things of this nature does not, <hi>de novo ponere,</hi> but rather <hi>supponere</hi>), but it receives limits from the Constitution. <hi>How far the Power of Kings may extend</hi> says Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> (not altogether to my thoughts) <hi>the Articles of Compact between them and the people is to shew, not only those at the beginning, which for the most part are worn out of knowledg, but whatsoever hath been after in a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary manner condescended to, by positive Laws, or custom reaching beyond the Memory of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:206017:33"/> Man.</hi> I know to this purpose, there is more then one sort of Government; and that of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> is either <hi>Despotical</hi> (or Arbitrary) according to <hi>Will:</hi> Or <hi>Regal</hi> according to <hi>Law.</hi> In the one there is no propriety of the Subject, therefore called <hi>Imperium herile.</hi> But the other is of <hi>free</hi> Subjects, who have propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in their Estates and Goods. Such is ours, when this allay is so eminent, that neither the <hi>Purse</hi> nor the <hi>Laws,</hi> is in the Power of the King but by the Parliament, and that freely chosen by the people. Upon this account, there are some great Laws in a Nation such as <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Charta,</hi> and Petition of right <hi>(Augustissima illa libertatum Anglicarum diplomata &amp; Sacrae anchorae)</hi> in this Land, which do oblige the King more particularly, and ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served inviolable. Now what if a Prince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench upon these Laws, Put the Case at the highest, what if he should violate them? May the Subject take Arms, or rise against him for that? I answer, if I may distinguish here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Kings own person and government, and those that act under him or are his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it were more easy for me to know what to say: But if I must speak indiscriminately, I will <hi>speak as a Foole,</hi> I think not; seeing such Laws themselves are with us, not <hi>Conditio reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandi,</hi> but <hi>Sponsiones prineipis,</hi> and who hath
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:206017:33"/> right to ask him <hi>What doest thou,</hi> or call him to account for it? <hi>Regum timendorum in proprios greges, Reges in ipsos imperium est Jovis. Pacta conventa</hi> no doubt (says <hi>Seravia</hi>) by the Laws of God and Nature are to be kept. l. 4. c. 9. <hi>Quae vero si violari contingat ab eo cui summum Deus commisit imperium, nullum esse supra su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premum judicem alium hic in terris, qui eum ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicet cogat{que} in ordinem.</hi> l. 4. c. 11. <hi>De Imperandi authoritate, &amp; Christiana obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true there are certain things the King swears to in his Coronation Oath, but if these be <hi>Conditions</hi> of his Reign or Crown, how comes he to be King, and to Reign before he be Crowned? If the Coronation it self be no condition (that is <hi>causa sine qua non</hi>), how shall any thing done at his Coronation? Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on gives not the King his Kingdome, which he hath <hi>jure haereditario</hi> before. <hi>Ʋnctio Regem factum significat, non ad Regnum jus addit,</hi> says the Author <hi>Deus &amp; Rex.</hi> If there be conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Reigning, then may he make a forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and be called to account, and how then shall the great prerogative of the King (as Lawyers speak) be, that <hi>he can do no wrong?</hi> The meaning whereof is, that his Officers and those whom he imploys, must see they act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law, or they must answer for it,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:206017:34"/> but the King himself is accountable to none but God. Who doubts but a Master may promise some things to his Family, and they have a right thereby to his dealing with them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, whose Authority over his house can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>Conditional,</hi> out of question? By the way I gather, there can be a <hi>right</hi> which may not be <hi>defended</hi> (I mean by force, if one could do it). The <hi>Persian</hi> King was most absolute, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and yet that he took an Oath with his Diadem, so that he might not change their Laws, we may not only have <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon</hi> and <hi>Diodorus,</hi> but the Scripture in part to assure us. And that the Kings of <hi>Epyre</hi> were wont to take an Oath <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to Govern by law, as ours do, <hi>Plutarch</hi> may be consulted in the life of <hi>Pyrrhus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But suppose Conditions, and they be broken, unto whom does he make forfeiture, or who shall take it? There are in some States <hi>Powers</hi> which are <hi>Coordinate,</hi> and there the Less may joyn and bring the Greater to question; and what some Divines have said on the 13th. to the <hi>Romans</hi> will be current in those States. But is there any such with us, that derive not from <hi>one</hi> that is <hi>Supreme?</hi> Who then is it shall do this? Not the Parliament, because they are called by the Kings <hi>Writ,</hi> and when the Authority by which they sit is <hi>from</hi> him, they cannot be Empowred
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:206017:34"/> by <hi>that</hi> in any act that is <hi>over</hi> him. Nay, will they derive the Power from the Constitution with himself, though he calls them? if he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits yet, and ceases to be King, they must cease also, and be no Parliament with him. The Parliament then cannot do this as a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Nor can any Magistrate or Officer, as so, for the same reason. Nor yet any subject, as Subjects, for that is contrary to all Order and Duty, and a destruction of the fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. What then can be said? Why this only, that the forfeiture is made to the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity (which is properly the <hi>Matter</hi> of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth before they have <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>orm</hi>) not under any other relation, but <hi>as a Community,</hi> and they must take it. If this be said, then cannot any part, or party, take Arms against the King, it must be confessed, not only because that he is <hi>Major singulis</hi> will be granted, but because <hi>that</hi> is not the <hi>Community.</hi> And if it must be the <hi>whole,</hi> as he is held <hi>Minor Ʋniversis,</hi> then can I conceive of what is said very easily, in the notion; but really it is a thing indeed never to be done. For if there must be at least the <hi>Major</hi> vote or consent of the Community, how shall this consent be given? who shall gather them together, or take their votes? If any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it, they must be men in Power, others cannot: But the present Power that any have
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:206017:35"/> in their hands is derived <hi>from</hi> him, and they cannot use it <hi>against</hi> him. Nay they cannot act by it, but they justify it. It is unjust to act by his Authority, if it be forfeit. How! Act by it, to the denial of it? They cannot act then by any Authority they have to rise against him, <hi>the Cause of it,</hi> and they have no other to act by; and consequently they cannot act at all. Again, whosoever they be rise first they are but single persons, a part, a party, or at most a multitude, and as a part or single multitude they cannot do it, will be granted. The <hi>Sword</hi> does signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>defensionem Regni &amp; patriae,</hi> says <hi>Bracton,</hi> and no man as a <hi>private</hi> person <hi>bears</hi> that. As the <hi>whole,</hi> they <hi>cannot</hi> rise together, as a <hi>part</hi> they <hi>may</hi> not; and so is the thing never to be done. I will add, if there be any thing yet, you may conceive kept in; That, there are the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy have passed over the Nation; the <hi>tenour</hi> of these Oaths runs <hi>absolute,</hi> which will hold those that have taken them under the State and Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Subjects: and consequently neither can the Sovereign make a forfeit, nor the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our judg the superiour according to the light of Nature.</p>
               <p>What then may the King act <hi>Arbitrarily?</hi> God forbid? I say first, Let <hi>him</hi> take heed, he is therefore Sworn to the Laws, that being
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:206017:35"/> not lyable to man, he should stand bound to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God. I can say next, that no Subject but may choose if he command contrary to Law to obey him, as he must not rise against him And that is perhaps bridle enough to Sacred Majesty that if any do serve his <hi>Arbitrary Will,</hi> he shall suffer for it as against the Kings Royal <hi>Crown and Dignity,</hi> though it be by <hi>personal</hi> command. The Case of <hi>Empson</hi> and <hi>Dudley</hi> is known in the Law and our Chronicles. It is the Kings <hi>Legal,</hi> not <hi>Personal</hi> command in point of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistency, binds the Subject. But what if any regard not that, and he persist in his Will? We must wait for a Parliament, and there we are provided of redress against such men. But what if he shall not hearken to his Parliament? Then may they with-hold the Subjects Purse in supply of his wants. And thus far hath the Constitution of our State put the reins into the Subjects hands toward the bridling personal Majesty to his Laws. But what if he shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon dissolve the Parliament, and take by Force what he cannot have by Law?</p>
               <p>I will premise here, that some (and not the unlearned) who have handled this question, and maintain that the people are not upon any cause to take Arms against their lawful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, do come in the stating the matter to distinguish between a <hi>King</hi> and a <hi>Tyrant;</hi> a <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi>

               <p>I speak this, and produce these Testimonies thus liberally, for the sake of some peaceable Spirits (and it may be over-strict Consciences) who are, or have been haply, look'd upon as refractory persons, in forbearing compliance to certain late Impositions, only because they having read more, could not Swallow some unlimited Words so easily as others did that considered less of them. But then, as for my self, I say first to the question, This is never to be supposed of our King; and next I have spoken before, that Majesty in our State I conceive such, as can make no forfeiture. It is not <hi>Potestas sub conditione,</hi> and if the Prince might <hi>excidere de jure,</hi> he cannot <hi>excidere de possessione,</hi> where there is none to take the forfeit, or call him to account for his doings. <hi>Omnes quidem sub eo, &amp; ipse sub nullo</hi> (says <hi>Bracton) nisi tantum sub Deo.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:206017:37"/> named, leaving the Heathen Orator and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher to their higher sayings. As in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity they say of <hi>Natural Power</hi> which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testas,</hi> The Powers that be, are ordained for our good: That Power which is not for our good, (that is the exercise of it, for the Powers themselves are of God and cannot be otherwise) is not <hi>Power</hi> but <hi>Violence;</hi> It is not the Power which is <hi>jus Imperandi,</hi> or which God <hi>grants.</hi> It is unlawful, <hi>injustum</hi> and not <hi>jus,</hi> and so <hi>in foro interiori</hi> truly <hi>unobligatory.</hi> But when I say and yeild this, I apprehend here some distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <p>
                  <hi>Bodin de Republica</hi> lib. 2. thus states this whole matter. There is the Usurper of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, and the lawful Sovereign, whether by Succession, Election, Conquest, Lot, or especial Vocation. The lawful Sovereign is either Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute or not. And there is the Stranger, or the Subject. For the <hi>Ʋsurper</hi> he will have him slain, so that the prescription of a hundred years shall hardly save him. For the <hi>Lawful</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vereign, if he tyrannizes over his Subjects and is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:206017:38"/> not <hi>absolute,</hi> he may be proceeded against by Justice, or Force, as the States of the Empire have done by the Emperour, and so <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Venice.</hi> If the Sovereign be absolute and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts the Laws of God and Man,</hi> there is the <hi>Stranger,</hi> who is of Force, as some Neighbour Potentate, and he (he counts) may come <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roically</hi> to chastize such a person, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Hercules, Dion, Timolen, Tamerlan,</hi> and the like. But for the Subject, where the Sovereign is absolute and a true Monarch, such as (he says) in <hi>Spain, France,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> it is not lawful to attempt any thing against them, their <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Dignity,</hi> be they never so Wicked.</p>
               <p>The conclusion comes to our purpose, yet will I put in some exceptions. 1. For the Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, This great Lawyer it seems had not lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to distinguish the <hi>Power it self</hi> which is of God, and his righteous dispose for the deserts and iniquities of men, from mans <hi>Ʋsurpation.</hi> A Submission to the one under due Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is no approbation of the other. <hi>Probantur arma sumpta in tyrannos in titulo</hi> (says <hi>Arnisae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us) sed non a subditis, verum ab extraneis, aut injustè oppressis.</hi> 2. For the Stranger I make a stand, what has he to do, who hath neither Interest nor Authority, to come and meddle with anothers Kingdom? <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:206017:38"/> 3. This volumnious <hi>French</hi> man had taken up what he says of our Government from discourse only (as he tells himself) with one of our Countreymen, and when he makes <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> an <hi>absolute</hi> Monarchy, he does yet lay down his <hi>marks</hi> or <hi>rights</hi> of Sovereignty so, as will make it not absolute. For the first and chief is, the making Laws, which he will not have enough, unless it be <hi>without consent of others, either greater, equal, or lesser then himself;</hi> when we all know, there passes no Laws with us, but they are Enacted by the King, with the <hi>consent</hi> of both Houses, and <hi>Authority of the same.</hi> 4. Though he treats of a Government <hi>Lordly</hi> and <hi>Regal,</hi> and puts the difference right as to the Subjects, that in the one they have their Natural liberty and propriety, and in the other not: Yet, as it seems to me, does he not touch the chief string; The <hi>Royal</hi> Monarch, he says, is one that <hi>yeilds Obedience to the Laws of God and Nature, as he expects his Subjects should to him:</hi> But so may the <hi>Despotical</hi> Monarch. The String that should be touched (if the Harp of their <hi>French</hi> Commonwealth were not set too high) is the Law of the Land, Will he have his Monarch to be <hi>subject</hi> to, or <hi>over</hi> that? We are not so shy perhaps as he. <hi>Omne Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium sub Deo. Rex sub Deo &amp; sub Lege. Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps est ubi dominatur Lex, Dominus ubi vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:206017:39"/> The Courts of Chancery or Law can avoid his Majesties Charters which are passed against Law; for the King is subject to the Law and sworn to maintain it,</hi> says Judg <hi>Jenkins.</hi> In his works. p. 48. And yet though we hold the King is bound to Govern, as we to obey him, according to Law, that hinders him not from being an <hi>absolute</hi> Prince, because we make not that a <hi>condition of his being King,</hi> but a <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of his Kingdom;</hi> that is the <hi>Manner</hi> of our Constitution will hold him to it, but takes no forfeit on him upon <hi>de failure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is the Constitution it self of any State, and the Laws built upon it. As for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution it self, there is no personal Sovereign whatsoever but he is <hi>sub Lege</hi> in that respect; The Constitution prescribes to him how he shall Govern. But as for the Laws hereupon for the administration which are nothing else indeed but the Will of the Supreme about the people so Governed, it must be acknowledged that when a Government is <hi>Despotical,</hi> or the State a <hi>pure</hi> State, the <hi>absolute</hi> Monarch in Politicks is <hi>over</hi> the Laws, because every Man is Lord of his own Will: When in a <hi>mixt</hi> State, as ours, where the Laws are not the Will of <hi>one</hi> solely, but <hi>All,</hi> in the consent of their Representatives, the Monarch here must be <hi>sub Lege,</hi> as to these Laws also, which is in
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:206017:39"/> it self clear. Neither does it follow because a Prince is not <hi>absolute</hi> with an <hi>absoluteness</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to <hi>Lordly</hi> Rule, or a <hi>pure</hi> State, which is hurtful both to Prince and People (when he may do what he please with the Laws,) that he is not <hi>absolute</hi> with an <hi>absoluteness</hi> proper to a <hi>mixt</hi> State, which is so equally attempered to the safety of the Prince and people, that he can neither <hi>violence them,</hi> while he is to Rule by the Laws which themselves have chosen: Nor can he be <hi>violenced by them,</hi> while his Officers are obnoxious (that they may not dare to act under him but according to Law only) but in himself left unaccountable to any but God for the transgression.</p>
               <p>I must not pass over this yet. The case put is about Arbitrariness of Power. We own <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluteness,</hi> not <hi>Arbitrariness.</hi> This requires our care. Let our forreign Writers plead to us <hi>Tyranni &amp; Regis parem esse licentiam, illud so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum interesse</hi>— To wit, that between a King and a Tyrant there is no difference but in their <hi>Title,</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of governing. <hi>Tyrannus erit qui negligit &amp; subvertit bonum publicum habitâ tantum ratione sui commodi.</hi> Arnisaeus in his <hi>Doctrina politica</hi> c. 9. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is <hi>Tyrannis</hi> in <hi>Arist. Pol.</hi> l. 4. c. 10. We shall grant them, this indeed is one thing, wherein
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:206017:40"/> they ordinarily differ, to wit in their ends. The one <hi>regardeth the Wealth of his Commons,</hi> the other the <hi>advancement of himself, his Faction and Kindred,</hi> as Sr. <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> speaks. But the formal reason of Tyranny as it differs from Royalty in a <hi>mixed</hi> State, I must place herein, that the one does <hi>govern by Law,</hi> so as therein he is <hi>Subject</hi> to it (which is <hi>Hooker</hi>'s Doctrine as the Judges before) or <hi>under</hi> it: the other <hi>brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Laws already made, at his pleasure, and maketh other without advice and consent of his people,</hi> as the named Secretary to two of our Princes (and thereby fitted to suite his definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to our State) does express it; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly does add, <hi>One may be a King in his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the Government, and a Tyrant in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration. De Rep. Ang.</hi> l. 1. c. 7. <hi>Happier that people</hi> (are the words of <hi>Hooker</hi> from <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chytas) whose Law is their King in the greatest things, then that, whose King is himself their Law.</hi> Out of the same Author he adds, <hi>where this order is not, a King groweth to be a Tyrant.</hi> Indeed there will be a ground laid by us, both of danger and error if we distinguish not of places. In a Government truly <hi>Regal,</hi> to become <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> is <hi>Tyranny:</hi> In a Government that is <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Tyranny it is certain, must be somewhat else. Let it be what <hi>Bodin</hi> or any of these mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will make it. We have this advantage in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:206017:40"/> our Temperature, that when in a Lordly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment the people may call any Prince of theirs Tyrant, whensoever they are in effect but disaffected, and have strength, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do so in ours. It is easie surely for them to say their Prince regards only himself, his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and profit, and neglects the common Good, and so expose him to the hate and consequences of that Name. But it will be hard for any ever to affirm of a Prince of ours, that the Habitual, Constant, Predominant, tenour of his Rule and Government here is not according to the Law of the Realm, by, and under regulation of it. In this definition then of Tyranny, I consult the safety of my Prince, <hi>Quod adpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mè est utile,</hi> and ought to be well taken.</p>
               <p>I know moreover such Writers who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned especially in the <hi>French</hi> State do speak high, that there is no true absolute Monarch, who is not above his whole people and the Laws also; and they cite <hi>Aristotle</hi> to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. <hi>Ʋbi Leges Dominantur negat,</hi> Aristoteles <hi>verum &amp; absolutum Regem esse.</hi> But the learned in the Customs and Laws of our Nation will speak just contrary. <hi>Non est Rex ubi domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur voluntas non Lex.</hi> The Sr. <hi>Thomas</hi> before mentioned and <hi>Buddeus</hi> (which is but the same book in <hi>Latin</hi>) do tell us of a double Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment a <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, where the <hi>Leges ferre</hi> does not lie in <hi>Potestate</hi> of <hi>one</hi> solely (as it does not with us) I must by this Counsellour's leave, take the boldness upon me to distinguish between <hi>sub Lege esse,</hi> and <hi>cogi posse; Legibus astringi,</hi> and a <hi>populo judicari.</hi> As there is a difference between a <hi>pure</hi> and a <hi>mixt</hi> State: So is there (as is before intimated) in the absoluteness of the Monarch, according to one, and the other. A mixt (<hi>mollis</hi> gentle) absoluteness will think it enough to be <hi>Soluta</hi> (free) from the one, when a pure (rigid) ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluteness will be <hi>Soluta</hi> from both of them. Let <hi>Bodin</hi> and <hi>Henningus</hi> who are <hi>French,</hi> and the learned <hi>Scot</hi> mentioned, being a <hi>Consilijs</hi> to that King, advance their Monarch to a Power so absolute that he may say what our <hi>Richard</hi> the Second was accused of his Nobles for say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:206017:41"/> that <hi>the Law was on his head,</hi> it shall be the glory of our Nation, that we live not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such a <hi>torrid,</hi> but more <hi>temporate</hi> Zone of Absoluteness, while our Monarch is contented to yeild himself to an <hi>astringi legibus,</hi> and <hi>sub lege esse,</hi> so long as he is yeilded by us to be <hi>Solutus</hi> from a <hi>Cogi posse,</hi> and a <hi>populo indicari. Et quod sub Lege esse debeat, cum sit Dei vicari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, enidcnter apparet, ad similitudinem</hi> Jesu, <hi>qui cum ad reparandum humanum genus in effa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biliter ei multa suppeterent, hanc potissimùm ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git viam, quasi ad destruendum opus Diaboli, non virtute uteretur potentiae sed justitiae ratione; &amp; sic Ʋoluit esse sub lege</hi> (Here strech not the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile beyond the Staple <hi>(ut eus qui sub lege erant redimerit. Noluit enim uti viribus sed ratione &amp; judicio.</hi> Bracton.</p>
               <p>If any then will still press me with the <hi>French</hi> Politicks, and what I have noted in my third exception to <hi>Bodin,</hi> who holds that no Prince is <hi>absolute</hi> but he who hath the sole Power of Legislation, and yet that our Prince is an <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Prince,</hi> I will make an end with him at once. An absolute Monarch <hi>accipiatur duplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Either we may understand by it, One in whom the Sovereignty is <hi>solely</hi> and fully, wholly and altogether <hi>placed:</hi> or One whose Dominion is not held <hi>upon Condition.</hi> In the first sense there is no Prince in a mixt Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:206017:42"/> can be an absolute Monarch, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of a mixt State does place the Supreme Power or rights of Majesty in him with others. <hi>The most high and absolute Power of the Realm of</hi> England <hi>consisteth in the Parliament,</hi> says <hi>Smith,</hi> l. 2. c. 2. But that our Princes of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> are absolute in the second sense, to wit, that no Mortal can take Arms against them upon pretence of non-performance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of their reigning, it is that we stand upon, as what <hi>pro virili, tam Mercurio, quam Marte,</hi> is to be maintained.</p>
               <p>To proceed. But what think we of the great case between the King and Parliament in the late War? Is it not lawful to take Arms in such a case? For the scanning hereof indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, The ground of this Case hath been pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced I suppose by most of the Sober, in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of a <hi>Co-ordination of Powers,</hi> not well understood. They have supposed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to be a mixt Government in regard of division of Power; As if the <hi>Tres ordines hujus Regni,</hi> were <hi>tres Potestates,</hi> as the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral States united in the <hi>Netherlands:</hi> Or at least as if one part thereof lay in the King, another in the Peers, another in the Commons, and each party were to defend his own. Now when in some forreign States there are petty Powers who depend not on those that are greater, but
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:206017:42"/> are distinct, and so have <hi>jus gladij</hi> (if they dare use it) in case of wrong against the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Many have been apt to judg likewise, that the Lords, or Commons, or inferiour Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates may do the like here, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the people, of themselves <hi>(bearing not the Sword)</hi> might not. Upon such a concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on perhaps as this, the Wars were not the first of that Nature which have been in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But there is an handsomer conception of our Government, as a mixt Government then this.</p>
               <p>The three usual sorts of Government being found to degenerate ordinarily from <hi>pure</hi> into their <hi>extrams,</hi> a <hi>mixt</hi> Government hath been invented as better then any one of the other, called a <hi>Free-State.</hi> A Government is <hi>mixt</hi> in regard of placing the Supreme Power. There are <hi>three Estates</hi> in our Land. Suppose these as some would have it, the <hi>King, Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> Let these three then, as thus conceived (though without any stress at all on the word <hi>Estates</hi>) be look'd on as <hi>one person,</hi> and the Supreme Power to reside in them <hi>joyntly as one.</hi> The King is <hi>a chief part</hi> (says <hi>Lawson) and may not any more be divided from his Parliament than from himself.</hi> The Supreme Power according to this is but <hi>one</hi> and <hi>indivisible,</hi> and the <hi>jura Majestatis</hi> shews where it lies. <hi>Legislation,</hi> the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:206017:43"/>
                  <hi>Dominium eminens</hi> as to the Subjects purse we know lies not in the King alone. Where the <hi>last Appeal</hi> too lies we know; and if the Militia were layn with its fellows, it would do the King not a jot of hurt in this notion, wherein he and his two Houses make but one, and when they are dissolv'd it rests in him altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Execution. Now if the Supreme <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi> be in these three <hi>identified</hi> not several, (that is, not in King, Lords, and Commons apart, but in the <hi>Corporation</hi> together) then cannot they be <hi>co-ordinate Powers,</hi> and the Parliament consequently can do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, which resolves the case. <hi>A Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament</hi> (says Judg <hi>Jenkins, is a Body composed of a King their Head, the Lords and Commons the Members; all three together make one Body, and that is the Parliament, and no other.</hi> p. 80. There is such an incorporation as cannot be dissolved without the destruction of both, saith Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> in his charge. <hi>This agrees with our Laws, and the Law of the Land.</hi> p. 168. Again. <hi>The two Houses can make no Court without the King. Before the</hi> Norman <hi>Conquest and since to this day the King is</hi> Principium, Caput, &amp; Finis Parliamenti. It appears by the treatise <hi>de modo tenendi Parliamenta</hi> in the Confessors days; By the Writ of Summons, whereby the Treaty or <hi>Parler</hi> in Parliament is to be had with the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:206017:43"/> King only; By the Oath of Supremacy taken at every Parliament, <hi>It doeth appear manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that without the King there can be no colour of a Parliament.</hi> p. 148. It is objected by Mr. <hi>Prin,</hi> The Parliament can enlarge the Kings Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, and therefore it is above him. The Judg answers, <hi>If the King assent, otherwise not.</hi> p. 48, This I apprehend short. Yea, it must not be the Power of the Parliament <hi>quâ</hi> Parliament, that is, of King and both Houses together, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to shorten or enlarge Sovereignty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the rights of the personal Sovereign, or Qualification of the Power, does derive from the Constitution of a Nation, which is the only standing, grand, original Act of the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And the Constitution must be above the Parliament, being that, by Vertue whereof, we must suppose them to act, and to <hi>be.</hi> Indeed the King in Parliament is in some sense <hi>above himself,</hi> and above the <hi>Laws made by them,</hi> but not above the <hi>Constitution,</hi> which is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant Law (a thing at least that is still to be supposed as though it were extant) and must controul all. Upon this account, or bottom, is there a Solidity in the Lawyers advancing <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Ʋsage</hi> to that pitch they do, when other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, <hi>Dies diem docet,</hi> and latter reasons, have the more years. The Opponent and Defendant therefore, both of them in earnest, are out
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:206017:44"/> here in their Law, if they think a Parliament though with consent of the King can do so. By this answer, or by nothing, is Majesty rendred fixt, permanent, and indeed inviolable; beyond the reach of yesterday, and not obnoxious to any Mortal or Mortals, but to the Will and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God only.</p>
               <p>You may say A Parliament with the King may do any thing, they can do this therefore, and if they please set up a new Government. I answer, I deny it. You, may persist, The <hi>whole people</hi> may set up what Government they please, and consequently cast off any. But the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are Representatives of the <hi>whole People:</hi> I reply, the people may be considered as a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity,</hi> or as a <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> The People in the capacity of a <hi>Community</hi> may indeed at first agree upon what form of Government they will, but in the capacity of a <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi> they can do no such matter. The reason is, because as a <hi>Community</hi> they are supposed to be in a State of liberty: but when they are brought under an order of Superiority and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriority, that is to be a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> they are supposed to have contracted one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and must stand to their agreement. The Parliament now are Representatives of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> not as a <hi>Community.</hi> The people are here <hi>Pars subdita,</hi> and cannot
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:206017:44"/> meddle with Government: Their Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives (who with the King are <hi>Pars imperans</hi>) are chosen for Commonwealth purposes, and when they can make Laws, for the <hi>Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,</hi> they can make none (as Waters can never arise higher then the Spring from whence they come) but in subordination to the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. If the whole Nation therefore with the King would change the Government. He with his two Houses must give up the Supreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and when they have declared a Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the State, the people are turned into a <hi>Community,</hi> and may come to a new Agreement. The King then and the <hi>Forty Counties,</hi> indeed <hi>might</hi> do this, but not the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Thus much from that Judg occasionally, to this purpose, though not on this account. But if our Government be a <hi>mixt</hi> Government (which is the thing we are upon) not <hi>really</hi> in the Constitution, but <hi>nominally,</hi> in regard of some Acts of Administration, it is another mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I know there may be a dispute held about the three Estates in Parliament, whether the King is to be reckoned as one of those Estates or no? That he is, there is a Royal precedent, and the transactions of the late times, as is known, in the late Kings answer to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments 19 Propositions. There is perhaps to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:206017:45"/> the reason of the thing it self; The three Estates assembled in Parliament may possibly be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but the three States of Government there assembled, or comprized in that assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. The three States of Government are Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, Aristocracy, Democracy: How shall the first of these three be represented but in his Majesty? And how shall our Government be <hi>mixt</hi> of the three, if he be not one of them? <hi>The Laws of this Kingdom are made by a King, a House of Peers, and a House of Commons. These three Estates makeing one incorporate Body are they in whom the Sovereignty and Supreme Power is placed,</hi> says the King, in those papers mentioned. Besides, who hath the hardiness to say, if the Spiritual Lords were absent from the House, there could no Act of Parliament pass, or that when they were removed of late from thence by an Act, the three Estates were then dissolv'd, and our Constitution Parliamentary at an end? Nevertheless Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> I remember, in his <hi>Quodlibetical</hi> paper does prove out of the words of a Statute in one of the <hi>Richards,</hi> and another of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and out of my Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> unto whom Judg <hi>Jenkins</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, that the <hi>three Estates</hi> of the Realm are the Lords <hi>Spiritual, Temporal,</hi> and <hi>Commons.</hi> Let me turn to my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> my self. <hi>The high Court of Parliament consisteth of the Kings
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:206017:45"/> Majesty, and the three Estates— These three Estates, and the King, are the great Corporation or Body politick of the Nation, and do sit in two Houses—But in ancient times both Houses to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi> Part 4. c. 1. Sr. <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> after he hath distinguished the King (as it seemeth) from the people, he hath these words: <hi>The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> (says he) <hi>I call those that the word Populus doth signifie</hi> (viz.) <hi>the whole Body and three Estates of the Commonwealth,</hi> B. 1. c. 7 Again, <hi>The Barons for the higher, the Knights, Esquires, Gentlemen and Commons for the lower part of the Commonwealth, the Bishops for the Clergy be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to shew what is good</hi> B. 2. c. 2. I have passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges by me out of <hi>Rawleigh</hi>'s prerogatives of Parliament, and others (I think) asserting this, which are needless to transcribe, seeing there are two passages express in the Thanksgiving for the fift of <hi>November</hi> inserted for the nonce in our Book of Common Prayer. However this be, If the Community of <hi>England</hi> when they set up this mixt form of Government we have (let it be <hi>mixt</hi> in what regard it will) were indeed so Wise and Reserved as to agree that no Laws shall pass, Money be raised, or War undertaken, without their consent given by their Representatives, called first to advise about the same, I admire they should leave the King at perfect liberty as to his negative Voice,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:206017:46"/> and dissolving their Representative at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. The consideration of the last of these a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone makes me suspect that these <hi>jura Majesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> supposedly reserved by them, owe their derivation to the grants of Princes, gotten from them by Contests, rather then to that original agreement. And if Parliaments as they are called by the <hi>Writ</hi> of the King do sit and Act by that Authority alone which having called can dissolve them at Will, and by no <hi>higher</hi> (preserved for them by the Constitution) from the <hi>Community,</hi> then cannot the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment take Arms against the King, any more then the Subjects, as hath been spoken. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentum est solemne colloquium omnium ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Regni authoritate Regis, ad consulendum sttatuendum{que} de negotijs Regni indictum,</hi> says <hi>Spelman.</hi> Neither may any argue here as against me, If the Parliament hath its Power from the King, then the Purse and Legislation also is in his Power. He hath himself all that he can give. The argument is from that Topick, <hi>Causa causae est causa causati,</hi> which must be understood <hi>de causis necessarijs,</hi> not <hi>de contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentibus:</hi> The King indeed may call a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at his Will, but he cannot command their consent when he hath called them. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less I determine not but this Power which lies in the Parliament joyntly with the King, does
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:206017:46"/> flow to them immediately from the Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Land when called, rather then from that writ that called them to consult upon such an end. To go on then where I was last. The <hi>Powers that are,</hi> are only the <hi>Supreme</hi> or <hi>Subordinate.</hi> If the <hi>Supreme</hi> Power be in the Parliament, it must be in them as one with the King, and as one with him, they cannot take Arms against him: If their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer be <hi>Subordinate,</hi> they cannot rise up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>causc of their being,</hi> out of question. The summ of all is: I suppose the <hi>summum im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perium</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> is <hi>Regale,</hi> not <hi>Despoticum;</hi> but <hi>Regale absolutum,</hi> not <hi>pactionatum. Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutum,</hi> that is, <hi>solutum legibus.</hi> Not so, but the King is to govern according to the Laws (while I say it is <hi>Regale,</hi>) but he is not <hi>Judged</hi> by them.</p>

IIII.</hi> One peculiar case farther arising out of several late Acts [wherein that Position of taking Arms by the Kings Authority against his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or any Commissionated by him, is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be renounced and abjured as Trayterous and to be abhored] taken into consideration, in regard of the Consciences of so many that are concerned.</head>
               <p>HAving ventured thus far, I proceed to what follows. The Laws of this Realm, it is to be acknowledged according to what hath been spoken, are made by mutual consent, by the King and Parliament, and the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>both;</hi> and hence it is, that the King <hi>singly</hi> is <hi>sub lege,</hi> when some other <hi>absolute</hi> Monarchs in a <hi>pure</hi> State, and <hi>Despotical</hi> Government, are <hi>Lords</hi> over their <hi>Laws,</hi> as over their own <hi>Wills.</hi> Upon this Foundation it follows, that if the <hi>Law,</hi> and the Kings <hi>grants</hi> or Commissions clash, the Law must take place, because the one is but his <hi>single</hi> Will, but the other is his Will <hi>joyntly,</hi> with his whole people in their Representatives the <hi>Parliament.</hi> Put then this case: The Sheriff in execution of the Law,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:206017:47"/> hath Power to raise the County against any that resist him; The King in some concernment, upon some cause forbids the execution, yet he proceeds; The King Commissionates some Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers to withstand his proceedings; he raises the County upon them, and for all that executes his charge. The question will be, whether he be justifiable herein or no? How deep this draws, I leave to the Considerate and Wise. If he be justifiable, then is there a taking Arms according to Law, that is in the Kings name, or <hi>by his Authority,</hi> against those that are <hi>Commissionated</hi> by him: and how then shall such an Oath be sworn, or Subscription be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, which yet is imposed upon the Liev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants and their Deputies of the Counties in one Act; on the Aldermen or Burgesses of Corporations in another: on all Deans, Canons, Prebendaries, Ministers, School-masters, or others, that have any Ecclesiastical promotion, in the Act of Uniformity; and on the Non-Conformists that live within 5 miles of a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate Town, in the Act of <hi>Oxford?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not for me, here to be peremptory and definitive, in a positive determining the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff justifiable or not: but upon supposing of either (to wit, that it may be he is <hi>not,</hi> it may be he <hi>is,</hi>) I shall be more sure and safe in the resolution of the matter.</p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:206017:48"/>
               <p>The reasons to justifie the Sheriff do lie in the foundation mentioned: But there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears against him the Militia Acts. <hi>An Act de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the sole right of the Militia to be in the King.</hi> An Act <hi>for ordering the Forces in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral County of this Kingdom.</hi> For asmuch as <hi>the sole command and disposition of the Militia, is, and by the Laws of</hi> England, <hi>ever was, the undoubted right of his Majesty, and that both, or either of the Houses of Parliament, cannot, nor ought to pretend to the same, nor can, nor lawfully may raise, or levy any War offensive or defensive against him, and yet the contrary hath of late been practiced, Be it declared and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted.</hi> In these Acts, and another as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the <hi>sole Power, Command and Disposition</hi> of the Arms of the Nation is placed in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty; and the word <hi>Sole</hi> as well as <hi>Supreme</hi> is used purposely for exclusion of the Parliament, that it lies <hi>solely</hi> in him, and not in the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or <hi>any</hi> deriving from them. It seems then, that the <hi>Law,</hi> which is the Act, or Acts of Parliaments, is not the <hi>Fountain</hi> of Power in the business of the <hi>Militia.</hi> It seems then (I say by way of reasoning, it seems) that a man who acts herein, is not to be Governed by the Law, but he must be justified by the Kings command. It seems then, that the Power which the Sheriff has in raising Forces for exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:206017:48"/> of the Law, must be under the check and controul of the King, seeing in his hands the <hi>sole command and disposition</hi> of those Forces, as all else in the Realm do lie. It seems then, that the <hi>Personal</hi> Will of the King, which must indeed (according to the Foundation menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned) give place to his <hi>Legal</hi> Will in other things, in the matter of <hi>Arms</hi> must have the predominance, ot rather it must be held, to be all one with his Law, and absolutely to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This I shall suppose first.</p>
               <p>It may be <hi>Objected,</hi> There are some Statute, or Statutes, which in the late times were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for resisting <hi>evil Cousellours,</hi> and <hi>Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Officers,</hi> and the bringing <hi>Delinquents</hi> to punishment, notwithanding any <hi>Letters</hi> under the <hi>Great Seal</hi> or <hi>Little Seal,</hi> in the like or the same words. I <hi>Answer,</hi> I dare not take upon me so much skill in these Statute books, as I desire caution, and refer such Statutes to the more Learned in the Law, and what was said to them, by the eminent of the Kings party. It suffices me to produce these Militia Acts, wherein the sole right of Arms is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be in the King, and consequently the latter Statutes taking place of all former (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of yet they are made but the interpreters) the Conscience is I take it in point of Law to rest satisfied therein; for whatsoever might be
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:206017:49"/> pretended or supposed to be Law before, <hi>this</hi> is <hi>declared</hi> to be Law now, and what, ought ever (as the Acts account) to have been held so to be. It is a Maxime in the Law of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (says my Lord <hi>Coke) quod leges posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ores, priores contrarias abrogant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will not conceal where indeed does lie the most grievous difficulty. <hi>I A. B. do swear, or subscribe, it is not lawful to take Arms against the King; and I abhorr the Position of taking Arms by the Kings Authority against his Person, or any Commissionated by him.</hi> It is absolutely unlawful I apprehend to take Arms against the King himself, or against any Commissionated by him <hi>for the execution of the Laws,</hi> or his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Will: but if he should Commissionate any to execute his <hi>pleasure</hi> or Private <hi>Will</hi> against the Law, here will be the question that is sore. Put the cases over I pray, as to <hi>them,</hi> put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as to the <hi>King,</hi> What if any <hi>Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Officers</hi> should come to destroy <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or the peoples Liberty, to kill the Country and take their goods, might neither Courts, Justices, Sheriffs, or People, resist defensively, yea and bring those Subjects to punishment? I will not give a positive answer to this question, there is no need always to do so. Nevertheless I will offer so much readily to it, as may give the conscience satisfaction
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:206017:49"/> in reference to the words premised, which here alone is that I make my task. I will suppose then, that it is not lawful on any pretence whatsoever to take Arms against the Kings own <hi>Person,</hi> his <hi>Government,</hi> or <hi>Laws:</hi> so that the first part of the words may be admitted on the account of what hath been said. And as for those <hi>Commissionated by him,</hi> it is in a second part, or clause, where the position to be renounced, <hi>is the taking Arms by the Kings Authority against such.</hi> Now I will suppose likewise, when the command and disposition of the Militia is declared to lie solely in the King, that it is not justifiable by <hi>Law</hi> to take Arms against those that bring his command in their Commissions, because according to the express words, as they appear, it is a flat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction thereunto. If it were lawful then for the <hi>whole</hi> people, when not for a part, to rise <hi>defensively,</hi> when not <hi>invasively,</hi> against any <hi>Subject</hi> or Subjects, when upon no terms against the <hi>King</hi> himself, in case of extremity for necessary preservation: this was not to be done by the <hi>Kings Authority,</hi> as justifiable by the Law of the Land (when the Militia Acts have declared the <hi>Law</hi> to be otherwise,) but if it were warrantable to be done, it must be by the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> upon which they were to stand. I say not the point so stated is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:206017:50"/> by the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> I meddle not with it, I need not: But I say if it were, I should the rather discard the unsound pretence of <hi>taking Arms by the Kings Authority,</hi> or by his Laws, which would not hold <hi>against such,</hi> when there was the <hi>Authority of God</hi> in the Law of Nature, to justifie the same.</p>
               <p>You may say to all this, It is not in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Parliament to give away the Militia to the King, but it must remain where it is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Constitution of the Nation. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, If the Constitution of the Land be such that it places the Militia in the Parliament, and not in the King alone, there are few I think read in Politicks, will affirm that any Act of Parliament can rise higher then the Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Nay, if any Law or Laws be made by a Personal Sovereign which do overthrow the Constitution, by vertue whereof, or rather according to which, he holds the Power he hath from God, such a Law, or Laws are desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Authority, and <hi>ipso facto</hi> null and void. The whole business therefore lies in this, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Constitution</hi> of our Land hath placed the right of the Militia in the King alone, or not? And here I know I am on the safer side. I confess according to the principles of Policy, it is a thing very agreeable, that where the Power of <hi>Legislation</hi> is lodged, there should
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:206017:50"/> be the Power of the <hi>Militia,</hi> that the Laws may be rendered of force; and where the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia is placed, there should be the Power of the <hi>Purse,</hi> because the one can command the other, This is therefore the handsomer noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I have said before, yet if it hath so pleased any Community in their framing their Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, for reasons to themselves, to place these matters otherwise, who can say to these <hi>Potters,</hi> why have you framed <hi>your Clay thus?</hi> And what if the Founders of our State have seen it good that they would not have their Laws made, nor Estates touched, without their own consent in their Representatives, and yet in the business of making Peace and War (where present Counsels and Expedition is necessary often times, that it cannot wait such a preparation as that) they thought it best to dispose the Power thereof altogether in the Prince, who can say any thing to contradict the same? I confess it is not in the Power of the King and Parliament to <hi>make</hi> our Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no nor to alter it; they are the peoples Representative to <hi>Parliament</hi>-purposes, not to <hi>that</hi> purpose, but it is in their Power to <hi>declare</hi> it; this is not only in their <hi>Power,</hi> but <hi>this</hi> I take it, is their <hi>Office.</hi> And though there be no <hi>declaration</hi> can be valid in apparent <hi>falshood,</hi> because truth is greatest, and must <hi>overcome all
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:206017:51"/> things:</hi> Yet when its impossible to evince the contrary, the declaration of our Superiours that are in Authority over us, must be obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, both because of the fifth Commandment, and also because otherwise we must be at an endless loss in the case. There be some to this purpose will tell us that the <hi>division</hi> of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galiae</hi> in our State, to wit, the placing the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia</hi> in the King, the <hi>Purse</hi> in the Parliament, and <hi>Legislation</hi> in them both, is agreeable to the <hi>Lawyers.</hi> I undertake not that, but I may be apter to <hi>believe,</hi> then <hi>disprove</hi> them; and when I suppose as readily as any, that in the Constitution of a State, it is very suitable to Politicks to lay these <hi>jura Majestatis</hi> or prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives together, and make them <hi>inseparable,</hi> and consequently that those persons who have placed the Sovereignty of our State in King and Parliament joyntly on that account, have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken tightly according to the rules and reason of those who write of such things: Yet when we come to the point of fact, whether it be so in the Constitution of our State indeed, or no, this is certainly another matter; and I may not argue, this or that seems most <hi>agreeable to my reason</hi> to <hi>have</hi> been done, seeing the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is only what <hi>is</hi> done? Wherein we must at last either have recourse to some <hi>records</hi> which are <hi>authentick</hi> to the contrary, or else sit down
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:206017:51"/> in that which is next of credit hereunto, the <hi>declaration</hi> of Parliament about the same.</p>
               <p>I will add, if it could be proved that this was part of the Constitution of the Realm, that the people might defend their rights against any that invaded them, saving harmless the Kings person, yet must this Position (in the words expressed) be discarded still. I make it good. The Constitution of a Nation we are to know once for all (whatsoever the <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Common</hi> Lawyer may call <hi>Constitution</hi>) is in Politicks nothing else but this, to wit the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal agreement of the people, how, and in what manner, they would be Governed, when at first they framed their Commonwealth: and if it could be proved then, that the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>England</hi> agreed or consented not to be Governed by King, or by a King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but on these terms, that they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their rights against either, if they were invaded by them, then must not their taking Arms in that case be by the Kings Authority or Parliaments either, or by vertue of any Law proceeding from them, but by the Authority of the Community who framed the Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by vertue of that Mother-law, upon which, as above theirs, the personal Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of King and Parliament both depends. But now in regard this is not a thing possible to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:206017:52"/> be proved, seeing we have not a Coppy of that original agreement, so as what is essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and naturally consequential to Parliaments we may suppose to belong thereunto, but otherwise we have nothing but the footsteps of the Laws which have successively passed in our Parliaments to insist upon, and they having now <hi>declared</hi> the right of the Militia, not barely to <hi>be,</hi> but <hi>ever to have been</hi> in the Prince alone, we are to conceive of this Grand Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is <hi>Magna Major,</hi> (and time hath eaten the words out) to have been accordingly; and not to have been contrary without Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony or probation.</p>
               <p>If we look over our Nation, the first time we hear of it with any truth is under the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> Then came the <hi>Saxons</hi> and divided it into an Heptarchy; then one of those Kings prevails over the rest and reduces it into one Kingdom; afterwards came the <hi>Danes</hi> for a lesser season; and then <hi>William</hi> the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and so we continue. Now where I pray, or in whose time shall we lay the <hi>Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> of our Nation, I mean, when was it, or at what time, that we are to account that it was formed? Shall we lay it in <hi>William?</hi> I think not, because though he was called the Conquerour, he pretended a good title, and altered not the Foundation of our State, but
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:206017:52"/> only added some Laws, which any Prince in an orderly way may do. For <hi>Canutus,</hi> or the <hi>Danes,</hi> they did less as to any alteration of the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution then the <hi>Norman.</hi> As for <hi>Egbert,</hi> who I think it was that reduced the Heptarchy, he did I account but restore the ancient Monarchy, and though he changed the <hi>name</hi> into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Government in the <hi>kind</hi> none can suppose but the <hi>same.</hi> For the <hi>Romans</hi> they left us in a Monarchy, and found Princes here, and if we look beyond them, we must come up to those persons who at first in our Island re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved upon Government, and that they would have a King. <hi>The Government of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by a royal Sovereign hath been as ancient as History is, That usage so practiced</hi> (says <hi>Jenkins) makes a fundamental Law.</hi> And here indeed does the prime constitution take his root: but who will say this is ours, or that ours is this? Who can tell us this first <hi>British</hi> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and declare us the Instrument of it? If you will have it laid by <hi>Egbert,</hi> we are as much in ignorance also, what the Nation consented to when they came in entirely to him. If we had that perfect body of Law <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor drew up, it might happily tell us something. But if then you desceud below the time of the Conquerour to find our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution out, where shall it be placed? Will
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:206017:53"/> you have it lie in <hi>Magna Charta?</hi> That must not be, because <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and <hi>charta de Forest</hi> or the like, were the grants of our Kings, and the Constitution is that supposed Law of Laws and greater charter from whence the Prince himself holds his rights as the people their liberties, and must be therefore another matter. Shall we go then to the Statutes of the Realm? Nay, these are all Acts of the personal Sovereign, which suppose the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign before, and consequently they do not <hi>give</hi> the royal Power, or <hi>make</hi> the State, but they <hi>declare</hi> that Power. The <hi>Lex</hi> that <hi>made</hi> him is long agoe out of books, the <hi>Lex</hi> that <hi>declares</hi> him supposedly according to that <hi>Lex</hi> that made him, does as it seems, in two or three Acts (which are the latest, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must stand, till contraried or reversed) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare so much to <hi>be</hi> and ever to <hi>have been</hi> the <hi>right</hi> of the King (I mean the Militia acts cited) as no person can <hi>take Arms</hi> upon any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence whatsoever against <hi>him,</hi> or on pretence of his <hi>Authority</hi> against such as are <hi>Commissiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him,</hi> without contradiction (I suppose) to that <hi>declaration,</hi> and consequently the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, as it stands now declared, is for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and prays to have costs.</p>
               <p>It is time for me after this to come to the supposition on the contrary in the case propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:206017:53"/> Suppose the Lawyers should determine that the Sheriff were to be justified notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Militia Acts. There is an harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or reason of Law in general, to wit of all the Laws together which concern the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in its administration, which have a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al habitude and relation as they consist with one another, that may be very near a definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Constitution in some mens apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. The Sheriff in our Land according to his office hath the Authority for executing the Law in his County, and so may in the name of the King raise the force of it to that end. If the Militia now does so lie in the King, that he may command off those Forces and dispose them at his pleasure, then is his Authority fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, and insufficient to its end. Consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that harmony, which I take it, they mean, by reason of Law, is broke, and the Law is made inconsistent with it self, because the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Sheriff, and the sole command of the Militia in the King, cannot both stand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether (as it seems) in this point. I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess moreover I am very tender in this matter. Here is a Position of taking Arms by the Kings Authority against his Person, and against those that are Commissionated by him, is to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured. It is not (I know) for serious persons to wallow any words in so solemn a thing as an
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:206017:54"/> Oath without chewing, and much less to be willingly ignorant of what the considerate have against it, who in pondering the matter will I suppose see quickly, that <hi>by the Kings Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> is all one as, <hi>by the Law:</hi> and when they are content perhaps to subscribe that they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr taking Arms in the name of the King, or upon pretence of the Law, against his <hi>Person,</hi> because the Law is conceived to preserve still his Sacred person inviolable, yet they may not be able to say so as to those <hi>Commissionated</hi> by <hi>him,</hi> because they conceive their Commission maybe illegal and that the Kings Authority issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out according to <hi>Law</hi> is to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which is issued out only by <hi>Commission.</hi> For my part I believe it could not be the intent of the Parliament as to the Major part, in these Oaths or Subscriptions, to advance the <hi>personal command</hi> or Commission of the King, above <hi>Law,</hi> I mean <hi>in genere</hi> to do so, which were to change the Government, from <hi>Royal</hi> or <hi>Regal,</hi> into <hi>Lordly</hi> or despotical. I shall offer it therefore as a matter of special verdict at the Bar of the most skilful in reason and Law, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any case possible of <hi>taking Arms</hi> by the <hi>Kings Authority</hi> in his Commissions (Note, I speak only in the matter of Arms) can be put so, as that the <hi>Authority of the Law,</hi> may be said thereby to be <hi>opposed?</hi> If it may,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:206017:54"/> the Case in conscience remains to be answered. But I question it, because the <hi>Will</hi> alone of the King in the whole business of the Militia (the <hi>sole Power</hi> thereof being <hi>in him</hi> by these Acts) as it seems, must be Law, or equivalent with <hi>Law,</hi> when in all other cases, not of the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, the <hi>Law</hi> is certainly above, and more then his <hi>single Will,</hi> and consequently hath place of his <hi>Commissions. Power</hi> is a <hi>right to command;</hi> That <hi>right</hi> in any Subject, does lie only in the <hi>Will</hi> of the <hi>Supreme.</hi> Well, if the sole Power of Arms lies in the King, then must the Sheriff's <hi>Power</hi> to raise Arms in such and such cases he is authorized to, be nothing else but the Kings <hi>Will</hi> that he should do it. The Sheriff now raises Arms in his name, one comes and forbids him in his name, and shews his Commission. Here, is not the Sheriff gon, seeing the King is Master of his own Will, and can reverse it? If you say it is not his Will alone, but the Law that gives him his Power to act in the case, I ask, how then does the <hi>sole Power</hi> of the Arms lie in the <hi>King,</hi> when it seems that it is the <hi>Law</hi> he pleads for his taking Arms, which is not the <hi>Kings Will</hi> alone (or his <hi>sole Will,</hi> which he opposes,) but the Will and Act of his <hi>Parliament</hi> with him? I will come to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion therefore, and leave the question. It is enough for me in the issue, if the <hi>Conscience</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:206017:55"/> be <hi>resolved</hi> as to a lawful submitting to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, though the <hi>question</hi> be <hi>unresolved.</hi> I say thus then, either the Sheriff is to be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, or he is not. Let these determine that will and can. If he <hi>be not,</hi> then is all objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vanished at the Militia Acts, the doubt and scruple is over, and we have done. If he <hi>be</hi> to be justified, then do I say that the Militia Acts must on necessity receive such a construction as that we are to conceive that the King and Parliament who passed them intended not to include any consequences of such a Nature as the <hi>disabling the Sheriff from executing the Law in the case supposed</hi> would come to, when they thought only of preventing <hi>illegal</hi> practices in all Insurrection and Rebellion. That is as much as to say, they intended to prevent any future War between King and Parliament, by declaring the <hi>sole Power of the Militiato be in the King,</hi> but they never intended it should be destructive in the least (in any case supposed or to be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) to the good and wholsome Laws of the land, which do empower any Officers for the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of law and justice, or preservation of the liberties of the Kingdom. And if <hi>this</hi> be their meaning (which removes all that is grieveous) and we may so interpret them, then must they in the imposing these <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Subscriptions</hi> mentioned be construed also in the <hi>same,</hi> and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:206017:55"/> no other <hi>meaning,</hi> and according to their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning are they to be taken. I draw this up, either it <hi>was</hi> then their <hi>meaning</hi> by the repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted declaration of their Acts to exempt all cases of the Militia, even that of the Sheriff insisted on (supposing it put) from the dispose of any but the Kings personal Will: or it was <hi>not</hi> their meaning. If it <hi>was their meaning,</hi> then is <hi>that</hi> to be held for <hi>Law,</hi> and the Conscience hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left to object in these Oaths or Subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons mentioned: If it be <hi>not</hi> their meaning, these Oaths and subscriptions must be taken (that is sworn, and subscribed) only according to their meaning, and so the difficulty is resolved.</p>
               <p>I pass with this advertizement. There is a <hi>strict,</hi> scrupuled sense <hi>(N.

And in this construction I profess (where there is any such) both that the Conscience ought to lay down

               <p>FOr the impugning the Doctrine of indefinite Subjection there are several things I know alledged, which might swell my Book more then is needful. Some instances (as of <hi>David</hi> and the <hi>Macchabees</hi>) are brought out of the Old Testament; and many things in reference to Religion have been said in the late times. But forasmuch as we have so much Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Resistance</hi> as there is in the New, and so many precepts there, of <hi>Patience,</hi> of <hi>Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> of the <hi>Cross:</hi> I shall commend these Texts ensuing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.39. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.29. <hi>Ro.</hi> 12.17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.10, 11, 12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Ja.</hi> 5.10, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.32, 33, 34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35, 36, 37. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24. <hi>Mark</hi> 8.34, 35. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6.8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18, 19, 20, 21, to the

               <p>And unto this Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers between him and Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> gives his suffrage. But there is an Objection of an higher moment, wherein I see not that they come off so easily; An objection of another Topick then from Example, which indeed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the very Nature and End of Government it self, and cannot be waved with faithfulness to this cause. It is this. If there be such a Power attributed to Princes, then may they not only oppress any of their <hi>particular</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects according to their unbrideled Wills, but they may take such courses as are destructive to the <hi>whole,</hi> and if we may not then take Arms against them, there shall be more care had for the <hi>Means,</hi> that is the Governours, then for the <hi>End</hi> (unto which they are Ministers,) the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good and safety of the people.</p>
               <p>I must acknowledg, I am encouraged to venture on this Objection by the learned Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:206017:57"/>
                  <hi>Ʋsher</hi> in his Book of the Power of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or else I should be startled, when I find those two great Champions for the same Power, <hi>Barclay</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> at a stand here. Barclaius <hi>ait amitti Regnum si Rex verè hostili animo in totius populi exitium feratur.

                  </gap>ance, that it must be <hi>animo perdendi,</hi> and in <hi>exitium totius</hi> is not to be conceived a thing in the World ever likely to be, and so not to come into the thought, to stumble any on that account. <hi>Quid ergo? Nulline casus incidere pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunt</hi> (says <hi>Barclay) quibus populo in Regem arma capere jure suo liceat? Nulli certe quamdiu Rex manet. Duos autem casus invenio quibus Rex ex rege non Regem se facit.</hi> Adversus Mon. l. 3. c. 16. In such a case as this then (and he <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> in <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Caligula</hi>) a King ceases to be King with him. Nevertheless I shall not so leave the Objection, nor yet trust too much to the notion of the prince being Unking'd in this case, seeing if he willingly prosecute those ways which will ruine the Commonwealth, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his mind, purpose or intention be in it, as
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:206017:57"/> we cannot tell, so it were little odds as to the main. I answer therefore in the first place from Scripture, the Apostle hath set down our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which is Subjection indefinitely, and we are not to break Gods command for earthly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, but we must do our duty, that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his command, and leave the issue to him, who can turn all things to the best. <hi>We must not do evil that good may come of it.</hi> And must we not do good, though evil succeeds? We are to be <hi>subject</hi> not only for <hi>Wrath</hi> but <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> sake; If we resist, we resist the ordinance of God, that is, we do not only break his precept, but as I must inculcate, we would not in effect have him to be the Orderer of things, we would dethrone him of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and be our selves in his room. Now when there is such evil as this at the root, how can we think that the <hi>possibility</hi> of the <hi>evil of misery,</hi> can warrant us the <hi>evil of sin?</hi> In the next place, as to the reason of the thing, I shall offer this consideration. To wit, As there is no mischief can befal a <hi>private person,</hi> that can stand in competition with the safety of the Commonwealth, or the <hi>whole Government</hi> it self, that for the prevention thereof, this should be endangered: So is there no mischeif or ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine on <hi>one</hi> whole Government but it must give place to the safety of <hi>all.</hi> I pray weigh it,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:206017:58"/> Upon the truth of this proposition, <hi>Quod nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la ex causa</hi> (in <hi>Arnisaeus</hi>'s words) <hi>subditis fas sit contra legitimum principem arma sumere,</hi> does the safety of not <hi>one,</hi> but <hi>all</hi> the Governments upon Earth depend: and there is no <hi>mischeif</hi> from the ill courses of any Prince, but is to be held better then such an <hi>inconvenience</hi> as the infrindgment of the verity of this Doctrine is, which were a Womb of far greater and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler evils. <hi>If there be any case wherein a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject may take Arms</hi> (says Dr. <hi>Taylor) there may be some other like it, and who shall be judg here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?</hi> If we our selves be judges, Lo what a gap is opened to Disorder, Warrs, Ruine, ruine of all, ruine with out end. It is true our doctrine dos provide for the security of Governers, even when the comon good is accidentally left open to oppression: yet in regard it is the concern not of one Government but all, and many Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours are good, the most but indifferently bad, and none at the worst so bad, but it is better, or more conducive to the common good, that we should have <hi>such</hi> as they are, rather then <hi>none</hi> at all, the security at root is not greater for the <hi>Means</hi> then the <hi>End.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now I pray let this I have spoken so roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, have its due grains of understanding. When I plead for subjection to Governours, I plead for them as <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>What is not profitable to the Bee-hive, is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the Bee,</hi> says <hi>Antoninus. Potest, quod inutile Republicae sit, id cuiquam civi utile esse?</hi> says <hi>Cicero</hi> accordingly in his Book <hi>De Officijs</hi> often. If Rulers rule not according to their Constitution, they are not the Powers that be (not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,) for <hi>the Powers that be,</hi> are the the Powers so constituted. Those persons who get into Rule without the <hi>title</hi> which is required to the Ruler in the <hi>Constitution,</hi> may not be held the <hi>Powers that be,</hi> upon the same account. Indeed the Ordinance or Will of God is a complex thing, which contains more then one matter in it; It contains in it that there shall be a <hi>Government</hi> and Subjection, and that those that rule should be <hi>rightful</hi> and <hi>right</hi> Governours, to wit, that they should have a <hi>due</hi> title, and act <hi>duely,</hi> according to the <hi>Constitution.</hi> But if any shall <hi>not</hi> have a right title, I dare not say that this Will is (as to us) there should then be no <hi>subjection</hi> For this
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:206017:59"/>
                  <hi>Will</hi> of God objectively taken being an <hi>aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> thing, some of the things it contains in it must be <hi>greater</hi> and some <hi>less,</hi> and God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we are to know (and then suppose) does <hi>Majus &amp; Minus velle,</hi> according to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the things he would <hi>have,</hi> or <hi>wills.</hi> It is a greater matter now (or a matter of far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concern) that there be Government, then that the Governour have a right title, and the greater matter then in the case I judg must take place of the less. The resolution of this will draw in its fellow. If a Prince hath a right title, but acts in some things contrary to the Constitution, those acts of his are to be esteemed indeed with out <hi>Power,</hi> and if the Subject does not obey him in them he <hi>resists not the Power,</hi> which <hi>Hooker</hi> may tell us clearly, if he tell us no more: But when the Subject may <hi>forbear to act,</hi> he may not <hi>resist;</hi> As the word in the original is opposed to <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</hi> undoubtedly he may not. The Subject is here to be <hi>restive</hi> (if I may so speak,) not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistive,</hi> I mean it as the people in the case of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi> was, they would not act, which was the right course they were to take, when they were never the less under due Subjection unto <hi>Saul</hi> for that. The reason for this is the same here as before. The right the Prince hath to the Government is a greater thing then the right <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o such or such a particular act. When I
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:206017:59"/> do then not obey him in such an act or thing unto which he has no right, upon the ground (which he perhaps may plead for my doing, to wit) of being subject to the <hi>Power that is,</hi> I may not take Arms and rise against him for that act (or for the imposing of that, or any such act,) because the right (I say) he hath to the ruling Power in general being a greater thing then this, I must give way in the less for Gods <hi>Ordinance</hi> sake. I return to what I was saying. The command of God does bind us to the Powers <hi>that be.</hi> The Powers thus and thus constituted are <hi>the Powers that be.</hi> We must make no more, nor no less of it then the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle. Whatsoever be the <hi>Powers</hi> then, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>limited</hi> or <hi>unlimited, arbitrary</hi> or <hi>regal, conditional</hi> or <hi>absolute,</hi> the inconveniencies that may arise upon the Subject thereby, will not dissolve their Allegiance, so long as they are <hi>the Powers that be,</hi> according to the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. Thus much I must declare and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg once for all, that the Word of God meddles not with the bounds and limits of the Sovereign Power in any States or Kingdoms, but taking them as it finds them, it requires <hi>Subjection to the Power that is. Chemnitius</hi> from <hi>Luther</hi> hath turned this into an Axiom. <hi>Evangelium non obolet Politias.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:206017:60"/>
               <p>Not but indeed there are diversities of Powers (or States) which must be considered accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their several conditions. The Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgenses who were men of great learning and pains are noted for this opinion. <hi>Imperatores &amp; Reges esse primarios vassallos imperij &amp; Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, &amp; proinde si feloniam contra imperium aut Regnum committant feudo privari, perinde ut alios vassallos.</hi> The ground hereof I take it is laid in the nature of other States which are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse from ours; and we may see, the Empire being the chiefest State of any perhaps with these persons, how they judg of other States thereby, when the <hi>German</hi> Empire is not an <hi>absolute</hi> Monarchy, it is prov'd out of <hi>Bodin</hi> at large, and granted by others. When <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> agreeably had taught that the Magistrate should not be resisted, and some Lawyers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to him that the Laws of the Empire per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted resistance, he then held they might make a League to defend themselves. <hi>Sleidan. Lib.</hi> 8. The reason of this satisfaction, was, because <hi>the Gospel</hi> (said he before <hi>Chemnitius) abolishes not the Laws of any Commonwealth.</hi> Under this fit construction, what <hi>Paraeus</hi> hath wrote upon the <hi>Romans</hi> may find its favourable allowance: whose careful Son excuses his pious Father, that what he had said of a <hi>pactionary</hi> State or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ought not to have been drawn unto an
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:206017:60"/>
                  <hi>absolute.</hi> And to this effect it will not be hard I suppose, to find Divines of the <hi>Germane</hi> States speaking as <hi>Zwinglius</hi> (quoted to me by him who shall next be named,) <hi>When Kings rule unfaithfully they may be deposed.</hi> Which we need not wonder at, when that eminent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late <hi>Bilson</hi> in his Book <hi>of the true difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Christian Subjection and Ʋnchristian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,</hi> wherein he does so stoutly defend the Authority of the Prince against the Pope, and all private Rebellion, he does yet (as it seems out of conviction) express himself with care, yet very plainly. <hi>There may fall extremities</hi> (says he, speaking of <hi>Chilperick</hi> deposed for insipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency) <hi>wherein Princes are not able to guide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and much less their Realms,</hi> p. 420. Again, defending the Protestants in their stirrs in <hi>Germany, Flauders, France,</hi> and <hi>Scotland, I will not</hi> (says he) <hi>pronounce all that resist Rebels. Cases may fall out even in Christian Kingdoms where the people may plead their right against the Prince and not be charged with Rebellion.</hi> I pray let us hear those cases. <hi>If a Prince should go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to subject his Kingdom to a forreign Realm, or change the form of a Commonwealth from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery to tyranny, or neglect the Laws established by common consent of Prince and People to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his own pleasure: In these and other cases that might be named, If the Nobles and Commons
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:206017:61"/> joyn together to defend the ancient and accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Liberty, Regiment, and Laws, they may not be accounted Rebells,</hi> p. 520. In short, the Pope may not meddle, but the whole Realm may defend their rights by Arms against Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Let us have his Foundation. <hi>I denyed that Bishops had Authority to prescribe conditions to Kings when they Crowned them, but I never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed that the people might preserve the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Freedome, and Form of their Commonwealth, which they fore-prized when they first consented to have a King,</hi> p. 521. Here I will joyn issue with him, according to what we have had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. While a people are yet in <hi>forming</hi> their Government, <hi>singular</hi> persons (as well the <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenter</hi> as <hi>Formaliter Cives</hi>) must be subject to he <hi>universal;</hi> In the <hi>universal</hi> then (when States arise thus, at least while they are rising) does lie a <hi>real</hi> Sovereignty, whose <hi>rights</hi> are to agree upon what <hi>form</hi> of Government the <hi>Community</hi> thinks best, and to appoint the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> (to borrow that comprehensive phrase of <hi>Samuel</hi>) of their <hi>personal</hi> Sovereign, as hath been before. If they be so cautious now as not to consent (which <hi>consent</hi> is <hi>causa sine qua non,</hi> or necessary <hi>condition,</hi> not <hi>efficient</hi> of Power) to be governed but upon terms, and their Governours shall be accountable upon Mal-administration, ordering some Officer

Upon this account what <hi>Luther, Zuinglius,</hi> and the <hi>Magdcburgenses</hi> say, is as good as what is said by <hi>Bilson.</hi> But here then does lie the question, whether there were indeed any such terms <hi>fore-prized</hi> (to use that <hi>most Reverends</hi> own words) in the <hi>constituting</hi> our Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> that the Prince should be called to account by the Sword in any case whatsoever? That the people have their <hi>rights</hi> is out of question, why else is the King Sworn when he is Crowned?

               <p>There is indeed one question lies at the heart of all, and that is, whether the <hi>whole</hi> people, or their <hi>Sovereign</hi> be greater? Which question if it may not be baulk'd, I dispatch thus. Distinguish we of the people as a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity,</hi> or as a <hi>Commonwealth;</hi> and of the greater, <hi>quoad finem,</hi> and <hi>quoad authoritatem.</hi> That the whole people, <hi>as a Commonwealth,</hi> are greater then the Magistrate, <hi>quoad finem,</hi> I think manifest, because he is appointed for their <hi>Weal.</hi> But that the people, as a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, are greater <hi>quoad authoritatem,</hi> I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it so farr from truth that the people as they are under a Commonwealth have indeed no Power at all.

Nevertheless take the people as a <hi>Community</hi> it must be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the original Grant or Charter from God is conveyed immediately to them, and the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of their Magistrate comes from that Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

VI.</hi> The general Case or Cases of Conformity, which respect the Church as well as civil Obedience, proposed and weighed with candour and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency, that the rigid of those that Conform not may not censure others that have Conformed, and those that are willing to Conform, and are able, may have peace in it.</head>
               <p>THere are two parts of this Discourse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the Title, The one of Loyalty against Resistance, which is dispatched: The other of Obedience for Conformity or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the present Establishment, so farr I could wish really as may possibly be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offending their Consciences, to all whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. There is a State-Conforming, and a Church-conforming; The Act of Uniformity, and the <hi>Oxford</hi> Act, with other Acts. A Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formist to the State may be a Non-conformist. The Non-conformist is not all one with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory. A Christian must conform to <hi>God,</hi> and to his Ordinance, <hi>the Powers that are,</hi> when he cannot conform (in every thing at least) to the <hi>Church,</hi> and will not to the <hi>World.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:206017:64"/>
               <p>As for Ecclesiastical Conformity, all are not alike easie. There was a time the Nation had the overture of a Concord between the sober of two parties, and lo, in stead of that compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition (which must still be implored as equal) a streight injunction of <hi>assent</hi> and <hi>consent</hi> to all things New and Old, or one of them must put up and be gone. How can those here whose judgments are perhaps, and have been for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in times before, as now, come over thus to one party altogether on such terms? This hath moved some to no good Will. Again, It is God rules mens inclinations; They whose conversations show them most faithful, whose Zeal to the life and power of Holiness is most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, whose faces are toward <hi>Zion,</hi> have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily no heart here, they go another way. This enters into many a mans Soul. Moreover, There are strange things in the Revelations, the rise of two <hi>Beasts,</hi> whereof the one seems to be the Power Ecclesiastical; and there is a <hi>Babylon</hi> spoken of, <hi>out</hi> of which we are to <hi>come.</hi> I would to God we were sure what this <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Beast</hi> are, that we could know where to be safe. I am sure our Protestant Divines have spoken so seriously of these things that they have frighted our people of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion so far from Popery, that we have run al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most out of our Wits, and can't tell yet when
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:206017:64"/> we are farr enough, least we be still in <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and the <hi>Beast have</hi> us. Such a Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things, as, whether by <hi>Romish</hi> Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or other way of external Worship or <hi>form</hi> of Religion, undermines and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes the Life, <hi>Power,</hi> and Spirituality of it, is the <hi>Beast, Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Antichrist</hi> for ought some know. And consequently there may be a great difference to such, between joyning with the Bishops, <hi>Cranmer, Ridly, Latimer, Hooper,</hi> in those things they imposed then, when they were coming out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and conforming to them now when their faces seem to be towards it. What? Toward Popery? No, perhaps they believe no such matter, but to such a way of Discipline and Worship, as carrying a countenance of either, but being rather only a kind of Idols thereof, by the shew pomp and formality of these things they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed contain not in them, the Life, Power, and Efficacy of both, is undermined and lost. This where it lights sinks in deepest. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless in regard our dwellings in flesh are dark; and Pride and Superstition are two close sins; we cannot tell but Separation may be the Child of one of those two Mothers. For as there is a placing <hi>Religion</hi> in those things wherein there is none, that is Superstition on one hand: So is there a placing <hi>Evil</hi> and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:206017:65"/> in those things wherein there is none, that is Superstition on the other: more weak, and perhaps more pernicious, as more against the goodness of God, and the conversation of Mankind one with another. I am you see im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial, God knows the truth on both sides. But were it not for these secret, deep impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the hearts of good Men, that we can't tell what they be (unless <hi>aliquid</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,) more then the objections only in their mouths and pens, the business of <hi>Conformity</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> might come to farther parley.</p>
               <p>To cary on this task then, there are three things that require our distinction and due consideration. The matter of Conformity, or the <hi>matters</hi> themselves imposed. The <hi>forms</hi> of Words, <hi>Composure,</hi> or manner wherein those matters are drawn up into such and such impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions. The <hi>scandal</hi> from without, unto which the tender Christian is to have such regard that what is lawful in its self, may not yet be done by him with sin to another.</p>
               <p>For the middlemost of these (to begin there as most commodious to the rest) I must needs enter this pre-admonition, that I cannot but think it a reasonable thing that those who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare such doses as are enjoyned in late Acts, for others, should consult with the Stomach of the Patients, to wrap them up in such expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:206017:65"/> as would go down best with them. There are the <hi>Compilers</hi> therefore of these Pills, and the <hi>Takers.</hi> I distinguish the parts of these in the point of their justification. For the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilers</hi> I say nothing, For the <hi>Taker,</hi> I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, he is to look to the sence and import of what is prescribed, and if he be satisfied in that, he is to impute the form and words to the Compiler, and not charge their oversights to the guilt of his Soul.</p>
               <p>It is true, the interpretation of an Oath (say Casuists) is <hi>stricti juris;</hi> and we are to think no otherwise of every solemn Declaration im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in our Acts: Nevertheless, as there are certain restrictions allowed to the obligation of an Oath it self, such as <hi>Quantum possibile, Quoad licet, Rebus sic stantibus,</hi> when taken: So in the taking, and consequently in all these injunctions, there are some conditions that are common to all Words and Speeches, necessary to be understood and granted, or else there is nothing can be spoken, promised, or sworn by any man, that he can assent unto, but what is spoken, promised or sworn to, in his own Words. Such a common condition now, I suppose this, that whatsoever is declared pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised or sworn in these matters, as in all things in the World besides, the words must have an <hi>Equal interpretation.</hi> There is the very <hi>let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:206017:66"/> and there is the <hi>meaning</hi> of Laws, and so of these impositions. The meaning is the mind of the Lawgiver or the imposer. His Will is t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Law, and his Meaning is his Will. In the general then we must take up here, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the form of words be, wherein any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is enjoyned, those that submit to that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, must take it in the supposed sense of the King and Parliament who passed the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their declared words, receiving and bearing an equal interpretation.</p>
               <p>Indeed the sense of a Parliament being not single, yet the declared words not varying, there is a latitude must go to an <hi>Equal</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; Neither is it material what two or three or more of the harder-grained aimed at in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing an injunction, for so long as a man is to take it only in that sense which he verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves was intended by the Major part, there is nothing but what is candid, or at least no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is unreasonable is to be attributed to it. If you say the Major part do differ in their meaning, and so we cannot go by the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Major part, you may cavil as well, the Parliament have no meaning at all to go by, because they have not all one meaning. I answer that <hi>that</hi> meaning wherein more do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree then in any other, is to be judged the Major parts meaning, and that, that is lyable
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:206017:66"/> to no more difficulty to go by, then if the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver (who is not actually to be consulted) was but one person.</p>
               <p>This interpretation yet farther which is <hi>equal</hi> must be left in its decision to the Conscience of every single person, as it is in the case of Scripture. Not to put what sense on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction he will, or can, as if a man might use his Wit here, as his Weapon, to defend his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: but to judg what was indeed the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers meaning; Neither wronging them in straining their words to any harsh or injurious Construction, nor giving himself liberty to serve his turn of the most reasonable, which he believes not they intended. Every man is to judg what is the Holy Ghost's meaning in this or that text, and from that he may not recede, without sin, in his actions. Upon this account are the Scriptures <hi>not</hi> of <hi>private interpretation (N. B.)</hi> when yet we are still bound in the practice of them to a judgment of private discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We must hold the same of all Laws, and these Impositions.</p>
               <p>As for the Mediums, whereby we gather the mind of the Imposers, they are various, some taking the common sense of the Many, some the sense of the Impartial and Wise, some the judgment of the Law, some the declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only of themselves to be the sense of the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:206017:67"/> words imposed. But let the Mediums be what they will, whereby a man comes to the resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his belief of the Imposers meaning, when he is once brought to a setled perswasion and conviction, that this or that and no other was their meaning, if he can submit to the words in the full latitude of that meaning as he is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perswaded in his Conscience is all they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in such or such an injunction then is he free to his own determination.</p>
               <p>There is a <hi>strict,</hi> or <hi>allowed</hi> sense of words therefore, I said in one Chapter before; I will say it over here more fully. There is a sense which a man is perswaded in his Conscience if he should ask the Imposers they would allow, as what in these things was their meaning: and there is a sense they would not allow him. A Christian, I apprehend, is to take the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions of his Superiours in the sense he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves they allow him. If he makes such scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and yields himself to them, which his Conscience tells him the sense which they allow him does satisfie, he wrongs them and trespas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses on the fifth Commandment. If he on the other side receives their injunctions without any regard at all of their sense, or in such or such a sense which his Conscience tells him is larger then they allow him, he is profane in his Conscienae, and sins in the matter against
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:206017:67"/> God. There is a Court then is setup for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one in his own Breast, Let him go to his Conscience and ask what think I really, as in the presence of God, if I could ask the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of these things whether it is their Will that he should be of another mind in these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars that cross his assent, or leave his station? If his Conscience tells him it is verily perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it was their intention in the injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he is to honour God in his patient suffering their pleasure. But if he is perswaded in his Soul that this is utterly against their wills (and was) and that the things he scruples at, or as he scruples them, never came into their minds unles to admit them, only they passed them in the gross, never intending that they should put a barr in Conscience unto any, and if he could ask them, he believes they would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly allow him in them, Here he is (I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) to put such a sense or meaning then upon the injunction, as may be favourable to his scruples, and yield it his submission. <hi>Leges sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis habent id quod plerun{que} accidit respicere</hi> (said <hi>Theophrastus,) quae autem rarius contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt, communibus tamen regulis constringenda sunt, quia etsi ratio legis in isto speciali facto specialiter locum non habeat, maneat tamen ratio in sua generalitate, cui specialia subjici fas est.</hi> They that please may read <hi>Suarez de Legibus</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:206017:68"/> l. 6. c. 1. For my part though I could use more words, I see no cause to alter any thing for my reading of him.</p>
               <p>For the Matter it self of Conformity, the chief stumbling Stones may be reduced to these heads. The renunciation of the Covenant. Approbation of the Liturgy. Episcopal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p>The last is the threshold to Conforming, and there is a first and second discourse abroad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Re-ordination,</hi> which as the Authors of the <hi>Grand Case</hi> and <hi>Peace Offering</hi> referred their Readers to, for satisfaction: So the deceased Bishop <hi>Worth</hi> once told me he had actually himself satisfied all he met with in <hi>Ireland</hi> but three <hi>Scots</hi> with the arguments of the first of those Books. For my own part, I dispair re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of proving any <hi>uncommon</hi> thing ever by Scripture if <hi>re-ordaining</hi> as to the <hi>work</hi> of a <hi>new charge</hi> is not exemplified in the instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are pressed in those Papers: and I must yet say freely, I am satisfied that the repetition of Orders upon the said account is lawful, when I cannot methinks be satisfied with it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any account else for my life, for this slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery <hi>Ice</hi> after tryal no where else will <hi>bear.</hi> Let a man produce St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the eleven Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and <hi>Barnabas</hi> receiving commission more then once, they will say this is still <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:206017:68"/> Be that exception then provided against, and forasmuch as this is the general case (for it is to a <hi>new charge</hi> if any now be ordained) let a man declare him self freely to the Bishop and others (those especially that have to do with him in it) that there is this account he has (whatsoever satisfaction he hath besides) upon which he can do it, and there is no scruple that I know otherwise, but he may find his ease for it (if he take heed) in that <hi>second,</hi> of those Discourses. In short, There is <hi>Re-ordination ad Officium,</hi> or <hi>ad Exercitium particulare.</hi> Though the one of these be condemned by Divines ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, Ancient and Modern, School-men, Councels, and Fathers: the other is justifiable and justified (as I remember) by <hi>Mason</hi> and as good Divines as any we have. And this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient I will commend from the practice of the Primitive times. <hi>Justin</hi> Martyr in his questions and responses (if his) the Orthodox (<hi>Quest.</hi> 14) asking why the Church did not Baptize, and ordain the Hereticks again, whose Baptism or Orders before was faulty, thus answers. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. That is, <hi>The error of the Heretick who becomes Orthodox is thus amended. The error of his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion by the change of his mind; the error of his
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:206017:69"/> Baptism by the annointing of the Holy Chrism; the error of his Ordination by the Imposition of hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next thing is the Renunciation of the Covenant; And here it is not for any to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themselves and think that less then this was intended in the Subscription of the Act of Uniformity, the Oath of the <hi>Oxford</hi> Act, and the like Declarations. They that took the Covenant swore they would in their place <hi>endeavour</hi> the <hi>extirpation of Prelacy,</hi> that is the change of Church-government, when in these late Acts they are required to declare, subscribe, and swear the direct contrary, that they will <hi>not endeavour any alteration of Government</hi> in Church or State, and that there lies <hi>no obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> on me then from the Covenant so to do. This is a manifest renouncing of it, and to be justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too only upon the account that this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular matter covenanted (at least according as it was covenanted) was unlawful, and so is it likewise expressed in the Subscription. In an Oath then (that every one may see before him what he does) there are two things to be distinguished, the <hi>Actus jurandi,</hi> and the <hi>Res jurata;</hi> The <hi>act of Swearing,</hi> and the <hi>thing Sworn;</hi> The <hi>Covenanting,</hi> and the <hi>matter Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted.</hi> It is not enough that the <hi>actus ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randi,</hi> the act of Swearing or Covenanting
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:206017:69"/> was unlawful, to make an Oath to be said <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful in it self,</hi> so as upon that account to be renounced, unless the <hi>Res jurata,</hi> the thing Sworn, or matter Covenanted, be found so too. This matter Covenanted, what it was, we see: And the alteration of Episcopacy as now esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished which is that matter, may be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red then, either <hi>Simply</hi> and <hi>Precisely,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard to the Covenant it self or them that Covenanted, and so we are not to suppose this matter <hi>in se</hi> to be unlawful (in favour to the concerned) but that it lies at the pleasure of the Power which is Supreme, directed by the word of God: or else this matter Covenanted may be considered <hi>Relatively</hi> and <hi>Complexly,</hi> as incarnated in the Covenant, and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the persons that took the same, in their capacity of acting, and way of prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and this <hi>Res jurata</hi> as to them who were in no capacity political, and acting not in order to the Will of the Supreme, but by force, and against his Will, must be unlawful and as against the Ordinance of God may be renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
               <p>To pursue this a little as clearly and honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as I can. Whatsoever Government (to keep on my ground at first laid) it pleases God that men upon reasons seeming best to them do set up in any Nation and comes to be establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:206017:70"/> it is to be look'd on as set up by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, and so his Ordinance accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Apostle, upon which the command of Subjection falling in immediately it is not for any single man, or party, to endeavour the disanulling of it. There is a Resistance of the <hi>Governours that are,</hi> which we understand easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and there is a resistance of the <hi>Government that is,</hi> and that I take to be in the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree an endeavour it be <hi>not,</hi> and in the lower, an endeavour it be <hi>otherwise</hi> then it is; which consequently being unlawful, we must distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of the Constitution of a Government, and the Administration. Alterations in the <hi>administration</hi> of Government, are made we know ordinarily in repealing Old, and making New Statutes: But the fundamental <hi>Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> whereby and according to which they are made, remains standing as the settled Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Gods Providence in the Nation. Now the way of any alteration according to the Constitution of our Government, is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, in the first Chapter to be premised; It must be by the King and Parliament, which being chosen by the people, the people there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in their Representatives do concurr to these alterations. A thing we are to know so true that there are no Laws that pass, but in this sense are said to be <hi>Quas vulgas Elegerit. All
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:206017:70"/> the Commons in the Realm are represented in Parliament by the Knights and Burgesses</hi> says Sr. <hi>Edward Coke Inst.</hi> part 4. p. 158. And are called <hi>tout le comminaltie de la terre illon{que} Summones</hi> in the preface of <hi>Westminster</hi> the first. <hi>Every</hi> English <hi>man is intended to be there present either in person or by procuration, and the consent of the Parliament is taken to be every mans consent,</hi> says Sr. <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> l. 2. c. 2. Nay while the King <hi>consilio &amp; assensu</hi> Baronum <hi>leges olim imposuit universo Regno consentire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior quis{que} visus est in persona Domini sui ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitalis, prout hodie per procuratores comitatus</hi> says Sr. <hi>Henry Spelman.</hi> There is a Uniform kind of Endeavour therefore after the common good, wherein every man that hath a vote in choosing Burgesses, may be looked on, though <hi>private</hi> persons, in a sense, to act in a capacity that is <hi>political</hi> or publick, so long as it is in order only to a Parliamentary proceeding in subordination to the highest Authority: when if he shall act out of that way, not in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereunto, such an acting cannot come under the score of a capacity <hi>political,</hi> but <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,</hi> being against the Constitution, which is the Publick (or the thing wherein the <hi>Res publica</hi> or <hi>populi</hi> does mainly lie,) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently against the Ordination of God.</p>
               <p>There are two suppositions upon this that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:206017:71"/> are contrary, yet have both some truth in them, and must be set at rights. The one is, that it is the duty of every one to endeavour the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Church as highly pleasing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; which when some words of caution and tenderness were put in for the avoiding Sedition and breach of Peace, such as <hi>in their place and calling</hi> be, it is no wonder if the hearts of a great many of the most serious in the Land were won by so good an End and tender Words, so as to enter into a Covenant for the <hi>extirpatien of Prelacy</hi> in order to it. The other is, that the business of Reformation which includes an <hi>altering</hi> of the present <hi>Government,</hi> does belong to the Power which is Supreme, and for any to go about it in a way that was, or is not in order to the consent of the King, in and together with his Parliament, is so far from being his duty, that it is a thing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to subjection, that opposes Gods Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that will not be content that Gods Will should stand, but would have the Powers that are to be otherwise then they are, and so entring into Gods Seat, as if a man could order things better then God does, as hath been spoken.</p>
               <p>To the former supposition then I answer, there was two things put together that could not stand together, taking the Covenant truly
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:206017:71"/> as it ought, in its complex consideration. To wit, An endeavour to <hi>alter the Government,</hi> and according to every man's <hi>place and calling.</hi> It is indeed according to the place and calling of the Supreme Magistrate, of the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to endeavour reformation of the Church and State as there is need. And it is according to the place and calling of private persons to desire and seek the same to be done by them. They may choose their Burgesses, Petition them, Advise with them, and Pray to God for them to that End: But to desire or seek it, and much more to swear to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour a change in the Administration of the Church (even so far as the extirpation of the persons therein governing) in a way that was not to proceed <hi>politically,</hi> by the act of the <hi>Supreme</hi> (for whether the Supreme Power lies in the King, or in the King and his two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses joyntly as one, nothing could pass while he was divided from them) is not according to our <hi>place</hi> nor <hi>calling.</hi> So that the saying I will <hi>endeavour</hi> it, but <hi>according to my place and calling,</hi> was an inconsistency in the Lenitive, with the matter underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
               <p>To the latter supposition I distinguish. There is an Endeavour of Reformation (or of altering what is convenient in the Government) that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:206017:72"/> is consistent with the Constitution, to wit by the way of Parliament with consent of the King, which appears to be lawful before God and man, and that must therefore be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and held: when there is an Endeavour, Not in this way, and so not consisting with the Constitution, which (let it be in what way else it will) is pleaded to be <hi>Resistance,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden of God and men, and consequently liable to be quitted or renounced. In our late Acts when a man is put to profess, subscribe, or swear that he will not <hi>endeavour any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Government,</hi> he is not to conceive that it is intended he should bind himself to lay down his subjection to the Laws, and much less to the Constitution it self of our Nation, which provides for the former Endeavour, so that if a Parliament be called, he is to act in their Choice, and consequently <hi>Endeavour</hi> in his place (for there he has place) the promoting the common good according to the constant practice of the Realm: But he is to conceive that he renounces the latter <hi>Endeavour,</hi> that is that endeavour which was carried on in the late times (unto which no doubt but these Acts have their respect) in a way not allowed by the Constitution, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently against Gods Ordination, where the unlawfulness of the War and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:206017:72"/> by me is placed. To wit, the Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Land is such, that whatsoever alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Government there be (which as to the Administration may, and are fit sometimes to be,) they must be made only by the King and Parliament; and Here was an endeavour of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration by the Parliament without the King, and against him; An endeavour by Arms to force the King to consent, in stead of that free joynt and mutual content in Parliament, the endeavour whereof alone it is, that our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution allows. And if the other be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, we see how the late Parliament-cause may be relinquish'd, when yet all lawful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour for the publick good either of Church or State is upheld. There was the <hi>End</hi> of that cause let me say, and the <hi>Means.</hi> The Means were covenanting without the King, and War against him. The End was Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. The Means I apprehend appears ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to renunciation, when the End is still by other means (that is according to the way our Constitution provides) to be sought. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, The Impositions that are, must be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the sense of the Imposers I have said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. In these late Acts, when the Parliament do require that a man should renounce all obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation from the Covenant of <hi>Endeavouring any alteration in Church or State,</hi> their sense
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:206017:73"/> is plainly he should not do as they did former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that is, their meaning lies certainly in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to former proceedings, to <hi>what of late hath been practised,</hi> to use their own words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cited in the Militia Acts. He is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all Endeavour which is <hi>Resistance,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the Apostle: but he renounces not not any Endeavour which is <hi>Subjection</hi> to the ordination of God i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

But the Constitution of our Government being such in the fonndation that whatsoever is needful or convenient to be altered, may be proposed to that End in Parliament: to take away that which is universally radicated in the whole Nation in order thereunto, were a piece of the greatest alteration that could be, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently never to be understood as intended by the Parliament.</p>
               <p>After this, it may be said haply, This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination were well, if it were Authorized: but how shall we turn universals into particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars without Authority? I answer, <hi>He that ploweth plows in hope,</hi> and I am not one out of hope but that these injunctions may yet come
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:206017:73"/> in due time under some revisory Explanation; and then may what I write (I mean the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents) become serviceable. In the interim, There is a concent of Reason to be understood in the Laws one with another, and of all with the Constitution, and Reason of Law is my Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. It is a general rule allowed by all Laws (says my Lord <hi>Coke</hi>) in the construction of Statutes. <hi>Quamvis Lex generaliter loquitur, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stringenda tamen est, ut cessante ratione, &amp; ipsa ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set; Cum enim ratio sit anima vigor{que} ipsius Legis, non videtur Legislator id sensisse quod ratione ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reat, etiamsi generalitas prima facie aliter possit suadere</hi> Inst. part 4. c. 74.</p>
               <p>The third thing in the matter of Conformity is an agreement to the Liturgy. And here may be included the old difference about our Rites and Ceremonies: and the new Declaration in the Act of Uniformity.</p>
               <p>For our old Rites. That the Church hath a Power to appoint Ceremonies I do not questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but how far this Power doth extend, is not perhaps so easy of decision. There is the Worship of God, and the Circumstances of it. The Worship of God it self cannot be instituted by Man, but God only, because there is none can know what will please him unless he reveal it. Besides, <hi>Will-worship</hi> is forbidden by the Apostle; To add or diminish by <hi>Moses;</hi> And
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:206017:74"/> this is the substance of the second command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Circumstances of Worship are its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages or accidents which when they go not into the essence of that honour, which we give unto God according to his excellence (the School-definition of Worship) do appertain as necessary to the person in the performance. Those Ceremonies consequently which are not necessary to the person who acts in a thing which God hath commanded for his immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate honour thereby, are more then circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the same (I will speak surer, are in my account or according to this adjustment I make, more then circumstances, or more then belongs to man to prescribe in Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,) and let them that impose them, or use them, look to it My reasons are, because this is a peculiar branch of Christian liberty to be freed from the Ordinances of men. Also <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, That which is unlawful and forbidden the Church hath no Power in, for our Doctors say her Power lies in indifferent things that are neither commanded nor forbidden. But it is forbidden by the Apostle to enjoyn any thing that is not to Edification. <hi>Ergo,</hi> In things that are unnecessary and unprofitable I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Church hath no Power (that is, hath no right from the Will of Christ) to put Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions upon us as to Gods Worship, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:206017:74"/> there can be no subjection due in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to such things. Things now that are necessary to him that acts in the Worship of God are so either in <hi>genere,</hi> or in <hi>specie.</hi> In things that are necessary any way I am willing the Churches Authority be owned, and I think one ought to submit his private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment very much to hers in judging a thing edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying or not. When things in <hi>genere</hi> are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and not determined by God in <hi>specie,</hi> these are matters we suppose, wherein our Church or Rulers Power doth lie; And here we must distinguish of the Imposition, and the peoples Submission. As for our Submission, I apprehend that whensoever our Rulers do act in their own Sphere, and the things they command be lawful, we are concluded under obedience by the fift Commandment. For the Imposition there is need of a double distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The one is concerning those things which are necessary <hi>in genere</hi> and not determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God <hi>in specie,</hi> and they are either such as are needful to be so determined; or not needful so to be. For instance, Time and Place are cirumstances of Worship <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ecessarie in genere,</hi> for there must be some time and place, and this <hi>in specie</hi> is needful to be determined, for else cannot the Worship of God be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. On the other hand, there is the Habit
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:206017:75"/> and Gesture, which are in <hi>genere</hi> also necessary: No Minister can come to Church but som ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit he must have on, and he must use some gesture: but the determination whether it be of this or that Colour, in the Pulpit Black, in the Pew White, or the like, this is not needful to be determined, because the Service may be performed though that be not appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Now it is a question to me whether it be lawful for our Superiours to determine of things that concern Gods Worship which <hi>in specie</hi> are not necessary to be determined. For two reasons. The one from the analogy of that text, <hi>It seemeth good to the Holy Ghost and us, to lay upon you no greater burden then those necessary things.</hi> The other from those I Rules unto which the Church is tyed in her injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to wit, that she do nothing to eay a stumbling-block before the weak brother, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is fit and decent and to edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But it is impossible according to the condition of our Nation, to determine such things in Gods Worship as need not be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, but it will scandalize many, and so can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be to edification, when it is to their destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Nevertheless the other distinction is here also to take his room, to wit, between the Matter imposed and the Act of imposing. Though the Act of imposing were unlawful
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:206017:75"/> (which yet I peremptorily say not, yet is the matter imposed, so long as it is about that which <hi>in genere</hi> is necessary, no other then what does belong to the Sphere of our Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, and consequently obliges the outward man in point of Submission. The <hi>outward man</hi> I say <hi>de industria,</hi> for whatsoever the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of our Superiours in indifferent things be, rather then <hi>resist,</hi> we must do them: though those commands in <hi>Ecclesiasticals</hi> must be for our <hi>Edification,</hi> and in <hi>Civils</hi> for the <hi>Common good,</hi> when they carry the Authority of God to bind the <hi>Conscience.</hi> See <hi>Suarez De Legibus.</hi> l. 1. c. 7 and Dr. <hi>Field</hi> on the Church. <hi>B.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 34. Nor am I ignorant here of the quarrel most have at these Ceremonies, meerly for their being <hi>Significative</hi> (which must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd in the stated account of them,) when if they were not indeed so, the Compilers of the Common Prayer would have accounted them unprofitable and relinquish'd them. It is one thing therefore (I account) to make a Rite to be <hi>Exhibitive of Grace,</hi> and another to make it <hi>Significative of Duty.</hi> A Sacrament I know in the Catechisme after <hi>Austine,</hi> is defined <hi>an outward and visible Sign of an inward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Grace,</hi> and some of our Rites you may say are made to be such. But this is not all the definition, we must not cut off there. <hi>A
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:206017:76"/> Sacrament is an outward sign of invisible Grace</hi> (such as remission of sins) <hi>given to us,</hi> &amp;c. Note that. Now if any Rite of the Church be made a sign of invisible grace <hi>given,</hi> or to be given to us upon the use thereof, I shall see good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for a mans dissent from her Liturgy till that be removed. For let me offer a little light here. To say the Church in such and such Rites makes a kind of new Sacraments, Take the word <hi>Sacrament</hi> in a common usage among the Ancients, and this is nothing if you understand not where the evil of so doing would lie. And where is that? Why a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being a sign of Grace <hi>given</hi> to us (that is of the grace of Gods part which he gives) thereby, there is none can be the ordainer of such a thing but God only, because it is he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone that can promise that Grace and give the same by it. If any mortal then should bring in such a Rite into the Church, and make it an exhibitive sign, that is a sign of the Grace of God given by the same, it were a most strange presumption in imposing upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, manifestly, as if he should be tyed to exhibit his Grace according to the Will of Man, or upon an institution of his, the evil and horrour whereof must appear in the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. But to make any circumstance of Worship, any piece of Decency, Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:206017:76"/> or Rite to be <hi>significative</hi> only in puting us in mind of that Grace which is our duty (not as what on Gods part is given hereby, but what is) incumbent on us to exercise and stir up our selves unto, at all times, whether we use this Rite or no, and whereof it is good to be still put in mind, I apprehend not my self the harm therein, at least not such as that this signification should make such Rites to be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments any more then the Fringes were made so on the <hi>Jews</hi> Garments for keeping them in mind of Gods commandments. <hi>In ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tubus, si materia sit ductilis, nihil tutius quam ea restituere quae primis post Apostolos saeculis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servata apparent. In hoc autem rerum genere quippe per legem divinam indefinito, recte fece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit summa potestas, si imperia sua subditorum af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectubus attemperaverit.</hi> Grotius <hi>De imp. sum. pot. c.</hi> 6. §. 11.</p>
               <p>For the new Delaration of <hi>unfeigned assent and consent to all and every thing contained in, and prescribed by,</hi> the Book of Common Prayer, and Orders, I must confess it is to me, too much methinks of all Conscience to be imposed under that strait prescription of <hi>those Words and no other.</hi> The design of the Act seems only to intend a compliance to the use of the Liturgy, and what need such a precise form of Words as this, or that of the Canon, in the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:206017:77"/> old Subscription? What if a man would use the Common Prayer and consent to it in other Words? Why might not that serve? It is a hard thing to be forc'd to bear ones Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the Book of Common Prayer in those terms as a man cannot declare to the Bible it self, or any Book in the World. If we turn to the Books of the Chronicles, and the Kings, we shall find it is said of the same man in one Book he was two and twenty years old when he began to Reign, and in the other he was two and forty. That these places are recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable, and reconciled in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> we will suppose: But if I were put upon an attestation to the <hi>English</hi> translation, which is our present Bible, <hi>in these Words and no other,</hi> that I assent to every particular thing and passage contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, I must refuse, or pause at least, till I have made my interpretation. We must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have our recourse here to what was said before as to the forms and composure of late in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions, and in regard the intendment of the Lawgiver or the Imposers is to be attended in all Laws, we may consider in the first place whether any man can seriously imagine for himself, that the Majority of Parliament could ever intend that he should give such an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation to the Book of the Liturgy as is more then he can give to the Book of the Scriptures?
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:206017:77"/> Or rather whether he is not assured that if he give such a testimony to the one as he can to the other, he does come up to the utmost of their meaning, and performs as much as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly they can be thought in reason to desire of him? We may consider then in the next place, there being some Mitigation proving here to be necessary, that when this man cannot declare to the Bible in those precise terms of assent to every particular thing in it, yet can he consent to the use of the whole, or to the reading of all and every thing therein without scruple. For instance, I cannot assent to the Words in both the Translation of the Bible and Psalter of that one verse of the Psalm where it is read in the one, <hi>they were not disobedient,</hi> or they <hi>rebelled</hi> and in the other, <hi>they rebelled not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Word,</hi> seeing they are contrary: but I can consent to have both translations read in the Church, so long as a good construction may be (as <hi>Hooker</hi> shews) made of Either. So in the Liturgy, I assent not to that passage of <hi>Athansius</hi>'s Creed that <hi>whosoever holds not that Faith entire is undoubtedly damn'd,</hi> for I doubt not but many of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that dissent in one Article of it: Yet who would not readily consent to have that Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Creed used as the judgment of the ancient Church, for the curbing loose Wits from the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:206017:78"/> danger of swerving about such Mysteries? To proceed upon this, Thus much I hold to be good, that whosoever could make this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, if the word <hi>Ʋse</hi> were put in, <hi>I A. B. do declare my assent and consent to the use of all and every thing in the Book,</hi> he may make it no less now though it be left out. For though it may seem a hard Chapter to give ones consent thus to the <hi>use,</hi> in such a form of Words as declares to the <hi>things,</hi> and not at all to the <hi>use,</hi> that word being left out: Yet in regard the preceding words of the Act which enjoyns this Declaration on on the persons there concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are express, <hi>He shall declare his assent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the use of the things in the said Book in these Words and no other,</hi> this Declaration in these Words (though they be in no other) must be understood to be to the <hi>use.</hi> We can have no greater evidence of what is the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers meaning then their own interpreting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, which they have also confirmed in the preamble of the <hi>Oxford</hi> Act. Neither may their Words be taken but according to their Meaning. Indeed I apprehend it not my self, proper to say <hi>Assent to the use,</hi> nor do I believe it easie for every one to give his <hi>Consent</hi> (which word is proper) to the use of every particular prescribed in the Rubrick and Orders, so that, as I do not know what advantage, or how
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:206017:78"/> much, may be made hereof, I must needs say moreover, that it cannot be thought by any that are considerate but that in an imposition which contains so many things in it as this, thereis and may be several exceptions picked up and pressed so to the quick, that no body shall be able to say any thing to the purpose, but thatt here is a tacit general allowance to be given to all these draughts of Men, and Humane things, as subject to oversight, diversity, and imperfection: and that as we have a refuge from the rigour of the Words of any Law, to the Meaning of the Lawgiver, so are we to pass a righteous judgment on their Meaning, that we burden it not with any thing that is intollerable, or not comporting with our <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual,</hi> and <hi>Believed</hi> interpretation. We must consider therefore in the third place more near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. There is a <hi>Consent,</hi> Let us understand, that is <hi>External,</hi> if I may use the Words of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Bramhal,</hi> and I be not mistaken; and there is a subscribing to the Doctrines of a Church as <hi>Articles of our Faith,</hi> or as <hi>matters of Concord,</hi> in the Words of Bishop <hi>Ʋsher.</hi> When a man is required in the old Subscription, and this new Declaration to assent and consent to <hi>all</hi> and <hi>every</hi> thing in the Liturgy, it is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent I apprehend that there be this <hi>Consent</hi> which is <hi>External,</hi> and such an <hi>Assent</hi> which
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:206017:79"/> is proportionable to things required only for <hi>Agreement,</hi> and not such as is requisite to <hi>points of our Creed:</hi> So that if a man will submit to the practice of these things established, and will not oppose any of them, this in short is as much (he is to account) as is expected of him in these Impositions.</p>
               <p>This is certain that no Laws which are Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, can meddle with the internal Acts of Man, and consequently that his assent and consent can be no otherwise, or no farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned herein, then is necessary to the resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the outward man and external Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. It is true also, There is a diversity of Faith, at least as to the <hi>Majus</hi> and <hi>Minus</hi> of it, to be allowed to the matters even of Scripture, and much more to the Contents of any other Book whatsoever. I will add, that I dare not deny but that it may be consistent with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of a Christian, in relation to many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, to speak and act sometimes with the <hi>Many,</hi> yet reserve ones inward thoughts in their native Ingenuity and Liberty with the <hi>Wise</hi> and fewer number.</p>
               <p>What may be gathered from hence farther I leave: But there are few or no Churches that have not their Rites, and Confessions, and the like, unto which they require the signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied approbation of their Ministers, especially
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:206017:79"/> when they first enter that Office, that they may stick the faster to them for the time to come; and it is not possible that all, if any who are men of Free and Searching judgments, should inwardly, and with conviction, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accord in every point, words and all, with the same. There is a submission therefore of ones private judgment and belief (especially I say while a man is yet green) in some point to our Superiours, to the Church, or Common judgment, as Learners yield to their Teachers, and the Client to his Consellour, which is an External kind of Assent (as I spoke now of a Consent to what they prescribe in like manner) serving to <hi>Concord,</hi> when there is no less than an internal experimental knowledg and faith in necessary points will serve unto <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I must confess it were a happy thing I judg when the most of our serious Fathers and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren are not unwilling to take a latitude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their sense of the things they Impose, or are Imposed on them, that they would come once to make the business of Conformity to lie no longer in any forms of Words, but in agreement to the general design only of those Acts which prescribe such or such Impositions: Nevertheless while those ordinarily who are in Power are so apt t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> look upon it as a piece
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:206017:80"/> of Wisdome, that they may not bring any guilt upon their cause, or the Church appear inconstant, or for the like reasons, to keep up still unto that which <hi>hath been,</hi> there is a necessity that men must be ready to bend a little and find out something to satisfie their Consciences, wherein they act, or else retire and give off for this World. I remember there was a time when <hi>Cato</hi> himself by the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of his enemies was brought to such a streight that either he must swear to a Law, and give his consent against his judgment, or else from the example of old <hi>Metellus,</hi> be like to be Banished; and he was perswaded by <hi>Cicero</hi> from his stiffness for the service of the Commonwealth, to temporize for once, rather then be rendred useless for ever after by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal. I cannot say that any man who is a Christian, may do so in a <hi>case of Confession,</hi> when he cannot save his Conscience: but if he can save it in this business of Conformity, I shall not blame him after <hi>Cato,</hi> for a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desention. And I think I may apply here the Wise Man's saying. <hi>Be not Righteous overmuch, Why shouldest thou destroy thy self?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the matter of Scandal. That now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, and does deeply concern this Argument. There are two Cases of it momentous in
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:206017:80"/> Scripture. The one is, when a man is satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied himself of the lawfulness of a thing, but by his doing the same he shall induce some others to it, that are either not under the same Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, or not satisfied in Conscience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the doing, and to them it is sin, which when a man shall reffect on afterwards, he knows not what a Wound it may be to him. <hi>If you sin against the weak brethren and wound their Consciences, you sin against Christ.</hi> The other is, when a man shall use that liberty he hath himself in a thing which is so abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to some of his brethren, that they be ready thereupon to fall away from the true Religion, and so perish inevitably. This made the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>meats</hi> (I apprehend) to be of so much danger in reference to the <hi>Jews. For meat destroy not him for whom Christ dyed.</hi> It must be acknowledged therefore by me here, that when a man is indeed in such a case as that he shall certainly give either of these two scandals to others, he hath need to look to himself. It is not enough (I fear) to say, The matter of scandal does lie in indifferent things, but when Authority hath commanded them, they cease to be indifferent, and then <hi>cessante materia,</hi> the scandal ceases. For besides that if it were not for this command and danger of the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a man should not at all be scandalized here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:206017:81"/> having no temptation otherwise to do the thing which is against his Conscience, and whatsoever is so, we know is not to be done for all that command: Besides this I say, such a solution as this, is so easie a way of dispatch, that Christianity I am perswaded, requires more care, and carries in it more difficulty then that comes to. A man (as my mind does give me) must yield an account unto God for that opinion that will loosen his awe toward him, and tenderness toward his brethren, more then he does allow. God commands, Thou shalt not do that thing which will stumble thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so as to wound his Conscience, or destroy his Soul. Man commands, Thou shalt do this or that thing which will wound his Soul and destroy him. Who must be obeyed, God or Man? If I say to this, God does not command, Thou shalt not do that thing that will wound thy brother, but thou shalt not do that <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> thing that will wound him, and when it is <hi>commanded</hi> by the Magistrate it is <hi>necessary,</hi> and a duty, this answer will not serve. For besides that this limitation is Mans gloss and not in the text, the bottom I think lies here, Where there is a <hi>former</hi> Obligation, as there is from that command, <hi>Thou shalt not kill,</hi> on the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence before, it cannot be taken away by a <hi>later</hi> as that of the Magistrates must needs be which
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:206017:81"/> yesterday was not. Moreover, That the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate be obeyed is a duty of an <hi>affirmative</hi> precept which binds not <hi>ad semper:</hi> But that thou shalt not kill, or that thou shalt not scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize thy brother in these senses which is in earnest the murdering of his Soul, is the duty of a <hi>Negative</hi> precept, which binds <hi>semper</hi> and <hi>ad semper,</hi> and so must take place of the other.</p>
               <p>There is another way of satisfaction then, that a man must find here in his practice, when he cannot be help'd by his Brain. It is this. The objection from scandal against any thing in the point of obedience, does not nullifie the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which is commanded by the Magistrate, but it puts a barr to the Action, so that a man must first remove the scandal, and then do his duty. Whosoever thou art that readest these lines, take this with thee, remember it for thy occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and bless God. Now then as to the first Case. Are there any likely in anothers confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming unto this or that matter enjoyned, to be induced by him to the same, who are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his circumstances for it, or not yet satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Conscience about it, and so shall be wounded by his fact? Then let him go to such persons, If he satisfie them with his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, they are <hi>edified</hi> not <hi>scandaliz'd</hi> by him: If they are not, he may charge them not to do
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:206017:82"/> as he does, by his example. For the second case likewise, Let a man set him down impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, and neither overweeningly of himself, nor unconcernedly toward others, consider whether his doing this or that thing is like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to have such an effect upon any, as that they shall be ready to think all Religion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to be nothing, and so cast off all care of their Souls for the future, or at least depart from that holy way of profession wherein they have entred, insomuch that he verily believes it may be an occasion to their everlasting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, then let him in the name of God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the thing. I dare not judg otherwise then so. It is beter that a Mill-stone were about his Neck, and he thrown into the Sea, then that he should thus offend any: and there is nothing so bad I hope as that, like to befall him in the forbearing. But if the matter comes only to this, that folks will be displeased, some <hi>grieved,</hi> some <hi>angry,</hi> some triumph, so that he shall lose his credit haply with a great many, some will count him a Knave, and others a cold man, and many will revile all the Sect for his sake: I do not think any thing of this, nor all this can stand in competition with Obedience to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. That the name of God and good Men are reviled, is a thing 'tis true, not to be made light of: but it is a mans <hi>doing evil,</hi> in the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:206017:82"/> it, makes him culpable, <hi>Ro.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.12. In fine, Do thou thy Duty with an upright heart, and God will take care of the issue.</p>
               <p>The business of this Chapter thus being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd, there comes into my mind for the close a certain prank of a Minister in <hi>Somersetshire</hi> a very laborious pious Servant of Christ that wrote for the Morality of the Sabbath, and was very Zealous in that point, who when the Book of Liberty came out, took this course. He read the Book in the Pew (as his theme) in Obedience to the injunction, and then went into the Pulpit immediately, and Preach'd up the observation of the Sabbath with all his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency, so satisfying his Conscience about it. I do believe many good men who left their Ministry rather then they would read that Book being against their Consciences (though in the judgment of the point I meddle not) did glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God at that time, witnessing a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession: and I dare not say but this eminently godly man (it was Mr. <hi>Bernard</hi> of <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb</hi>) did bear his testimony as well to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, and kept his Ministry. I say not neither assuredly that his action was laudable, but I say the best of the dead. The one might glorifie God in an act of prudence and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to his Flock, as the other in self-denyal
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:206017:83"/> and abrenunciation. I let this instance pass on purpose in regard this difficult case may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. A Minister is put to read a thing that in his Conscience is unlawful; He must obey the Magistrate, and he must be true to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. If he cannot obey man, but he must offend God, he must choose to suffer. But if he can obey, and be true also to God, if he see the way clear to do both, that methinks were to be chosen. When an act is evil in it <hi>self,</hi> it must be avoided, but if it be evil only in the <hi>Consequences</hi> of it (as reading in this case seems to be,) let those consequences be prevented, and the act is free. Where a testimony for God does preponderate the service of man, much methinks may be done. After I had wrote this, I light on Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> in his Cases l. 3. p. 243. with 176. <hi>Mauritius</hi> commands <hi>Gregory</hi> to hand an Edict to the Churches, that no Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier should turn Monk without his leave; This in his Conscience is wicked; Hereupon he admonishes the Emperour of it, Prays, Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, declaims against it, yet withal upon the command publishes the Edict, giving this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it. <hi>Ʋtrobi{que} quae debui exolvi, qui im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratori obedientiam praebui, &amp; pro Deo quod sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si, minime tacui.</hi> The Dr. hereupon resolves the case very boldly. <hi>The unlawful Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Edicts of a true Prince may be published
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:206017:83"/> by the Clergy in their several Charges, yet they must not conceal from the people any part of their duty, nor from the Prince, if they can declare it.</hi> My thoughts here you may see are something parallel, but more fearfull in coming on to the main entendment. There are many at this day of those they call Non-conformists have left their Livings and Station in the publick Ministry upon the Act of Uniformity. I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the most have done it very honestly and to God's glory, though some of them the Lord knows not without Humane frailty. I know not whether the same persons might again find out some way of doubling the service of his name, in resuming their Ministry, with the preservation of their Consciences, which (how much or little so ever this Mite of mine may conduce unto) are not perhaps incompatible to those that will use search and entreaty in the matter. They have born their Testimony for Reformation against present Impositions, now they may bear their Testimony also for Peace against Schism, obstinacy, and faction. They have exercised self-denial, let them exercise Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Charity, toleration. St. <hi>Paul</hi> who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood <hi>Peter</hi> against the Ceremonies, did upon occasion after conform himself to them. A good Christian may have more ways then one to glorifie God in his generation.</p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:206017:84"/>
               <p>I will acknowledg there are twenty things and more, which, if they be severely pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on tender and reflective minds, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to stumble them; and I am not the man who am like to go about the answering all particulars of that kind: Nevertheless, if there be any persons fearing God shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that enlargement of heart by the Rule I have laid them down, or any consideration else which I offer them in the general only, so as they can retain their Ministry, and submit to these Impositions which otherwise they could not, or others cannot, I shall have no cause I hope but that I may bless God for it, who does ordinarily according to his manifold Wisdom and Goodness toward his Church, in such turns of his Providence as these, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide some persons to be his Confessors, and to lay down all they have rather then offend their Consciences: and some to carry on the publick work without deserting their Station, and yet maintaining their integrity in what they do. Neither may that Author be less studious of charity toward his brethren, and of the honour of God thereby, who does industriously endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to heal the scruples of those that out of Conscience do Conform, then another who offers his Apology for such who out of Conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence also, dare not. I confess if a man can
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:206017:84"/> by no means save his Conscience I have done, or if his heart cannot bear it. If he may enter again into the Vineyard without cloggs, and his Soul be in frame for it, it is what he should desire of God. But if he cannot, why should he become a <hi>burden to himself?</hi> God will have <hi>Mercy</hi> I hope, and not <hi>Sacrifice</hi> in this case.</p>
               <p>After all, I have yet one thing methinks which I must also offer. Suppose a man who hath been a Non-conformist hitherto, should come to this resolution; To wit, to be ready to conform, in declaring, subscribing, and yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to whatsoever is imposed, so far, or to so much as ever he can according to his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and if that will not serve his turn, to be fixt, not to go a jot farther, for any thing, or any body: but if it will serve him, and they wink at the rest, to be contented to do so, and to try. Suppose farther, that such a one should publish this, so that it being known as far, <hi>how</hi> he does it, as <hi>what</hi> he does, he shall not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by become guilty of active scandal unto any, seeing if others do as he does, and but so, they will do no more then according to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, as he resolves as to his, and so shall they not be wounded by the example: If they be troubled only, that another does (if he could, or if he can) what they can't or won't,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:206017:85"/> That I count must give place to edification. I ask, what may be said unto this? Let the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent give judgment. It may be possible some may scruple, or object, that the fear of God which requires our obedience to Superiors will not stand at any time with such a prefunctory or unfaithful performance of their command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I answer, As the commands which are divine reach but to a mans <hi>Natural</hi> Can, that if he does what he is able, God accepts of the <hi>Will,</hi> for that which he <hi>Cannot:</hi> So the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands which are Humane, reach only to our <hi>Moral</hi> Can, that when a man hath done so much of them as his Conscience will let him without sin, or is able to render a sufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why he does no more, this is to be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of him, as perfect in its kind. <hi>Leges hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manae</hi> (says <hi>Grotius) vim obligandi tum demùm habent, si latae sint ad humanum modum, non si onus injungant, quod a ratione &amp; natura plané abhorreat.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> The Conclusion for Peace.</head>
               <p>HAving asserted the inviolable authority of the present Powers over us, and our Subjection to them as the <hi>Ordinance of God,</hi> against all principles, inclinations, and pretences of future disturbance in this Nation, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red some endeavours for a universal compliance (so far as may be, and as I can) of the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encious with their injunctions: I do think it but seasonable that regard be had now to the reciprocal duty and pious affection which the Magistrate ought to bear toward his subjects, that seeing their fidelity to him, and so his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity does hang so much as it does on Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Conscience, he may be exceeding ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their Consciences in the matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: wherein, as he is to take heed he doeth not <hi>exceed,</hi> we are not to desire he should <hi>neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi> the Commission he hath from God about it.</p>
               <p>If any expect some Determination on this point, it must suffice the judicious, if I offer him here only this contraction.</p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:206017:86"/>
               <p>There is a difference to be held in the first place, between the Magistrates <hi>taking care</hi> of Religion: and his <hi>compelling</hi> people to it. No body can force another to <hi>believe</hi> any thing which he does not, and consequently not to <hi>practice</hi> any thing which is not to be done but upon that Faith. There is a difference again next, between the compelling men to their duty even in Religion, which is <hi>according</hi> to their Consciences: and the compelling them to any thing <hi>against</hi> their Consciences what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it be in the World, especially in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of supernatural Revelation. To act against a mans Conscience is sin. But the Magistrate cannot command a man to sin. There is a difference lastly between the not <hi>forcing</hi> any to a thing <hi>against</hi> their Consciences, which the Magistrate must take heed to do: and the <hi>restraining</hi> men from doing things <hi>according</hi> to their Consciences, when they are erroneous, and when if he let them alone, they may bring <hi>themselves</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>State</hi> to ruine. There is no Toleration to be desired of the Non-conformist that is sober, but one <hi>Stated,</hi> and so far agreed to in the general, that the <hi>Articles of Religion,</hi> a <hi>good Life,</hi> and the <hi>Government of the Nation</hi> be secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:206017:86"/>
               <p>We know it hath pleased his Majesty to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press his gracious inclinations to Moderation on several opportunities: and diverse Papers have been published for the advancement of so blessed a design. It would be no good News to hear that the hopes of something of that nature should have put any at a farther distance then they were in before to Unity. Upon which account it seems to me but an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest thing to let these Sheets go abroad for <hi>Obedience,</hi> among others that have been sent out for <hi>Condescention</hi> and <hi>Indulgence.</hi> I would fain indeed do what I could equally on both sides, that one party should come up as far as ever they can, and the other in what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cannot, might yield to them. I would not be partial to my own intentions, which being displayed thus indifferently, I shall hope for Candour from the concerned, and that the <hi>Integrity</hi> of my <hi>Endeavour</hi> shall compound for the <hi>Meaneness</hi> of the <hi>Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are Objections or Arguments against Conformity in some Papers, particularly in regard to the <hi>Oxford-Oath</hi> and the <hi>Subscription,</hi> which cannot (as I believe) receive solution by any but one way only, intimated in the fourth and Sixt Chapters preceding, that is by a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated Construction of such Impositions. And
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:206017:87"/> forasmuch as they who were concern'd hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to answer them, either would not, or could not tell how to do it, when yet there are no Ministers that are Conformists but do <hi>Subscibe,</hi> and several of the eminent Non-conforrmists have took that <hi>Oath:</hi> it is no little nor unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary piece of Charity and Righteousness to both these sorts of persons, that I have propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed such a Rule to walk by under the injunctions of our Superiours, as that they who <hi>Conform</hi> to them, and those that <hi>cannot,</hi> may see reason to retain a fair opinion of one another, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that neither have departed from a good Conscience in what they do.</p>
               <p>I will instance in that Oath for Example. Let us in the first Clause of it, understand by <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Arms</hi> the <hi>raising an Army,</hi> or a <hi>Warr</hi> (which is truly the proper meaning,) and by the <hi>King,</hi> the King's own sacred <hi>Person,</hi> and I see nothing but one may subscribe these Words <hi>I A. B. Do swear that</hi> (I hold, or believe, which is to be understood) <hi>it is not lawful to take Arms against the King upon any pretence whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</hi> In the second Clause let us understand by those <hi>Commissionated by him</hi> such as have a due Authority from him, and exercise it only according to Law (which is likewise the true meaning) and I see no more difficulty in this Clause neither. <hi>And I do abhor</hi> (that is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:206017:87"/> or disclaim) <hi>that trayterous Position of taking Arms by his Authority against his Person, or against any Commissionated by him, in the pursuit of any such Commissions,</hi> that is <hi>Legally</hi> Commissionated by him, and in the <hi>Legal</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of such Commissions. In the third Clause let us distinguish an <hi>Endeavour</hi> to Change or Reform any thing in the Church or State which we think conducive to the good of the Nation in a Parliamentary way only as is allowed by the fundamental Law and Course of the Realm, from an <hi>Endeavour</hi> (as before) in any other way that is not so warranted, to wit, in a seditious way, or in such a manner as they did in the late t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mes, when they endeavoured the extirpation of Prelacy by force, against, and without the Kings Consent in Parliament, and let us take this to be the sense (as I think it was) of the Majority of those that passed the Act, and then is the offence over in the last part of the Oath also. <hi>And that I will not endeavour any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Government, either in Church or State,</hi> To wit, in any manner not warranted by the Constitution of the Land, or any otherwise then by Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>Not but I am highly sensible of one evil and inconvenience in our late Impositions more then heretofore, which is, that they make mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Government</hi> to become <hi>Cases of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:206017:88"/> and so engage the poor <hi>Divine</hi> upon the work of the <hi>States-man</hi> and the <hi>Lawyer.</hi> If there be no other benefit then comes by this Book there shall be this however, that the Wise will see of what nature and difficulty <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> indeed is, while such points as you find here are brought into dispute, and so into doubt and danger by the occasion: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently what reason there is for the withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such Acts which (to say no more then so) do put so slender a person as I, upon the Argument of these Papers. It is not for a man to be lead to an <hi>Oath,</hi> as a Bruit to a <hi>Stake,</hi> before he hath considered what he <hi>Swears</hi> or <hi>Subscribes.</hi> And it is in vain to talk of considering any thing, if we dare not look into it to the bottom. Thou shalt <hi>Swear</hi> says the Scripture, so say I, Thou shalt <hi>Declare,</hi> thou shalt <hi>Subscribe,</hi> thou shalt <hi>Conform</hi> (if thou doest at all) in <hi>Judgment, in Truth, and in Righteousness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It hath been always a grievous thing to me, I must profess, to see any troubled for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, who am solicitous for them lest that trouble should hurry them to the doing some things they are unsatisfied to do, and wound their Souls. If they are wounded, I methinks am wounded, afflicted, and suffer with them. My heart longs for some Accomodation, and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted rest for the Land: for <hi>Accomodation</hi> with the

                  <hi>Sober,</hi> and <hi>Moderation</hi> towards <hi>all men.</hi> Yet am I wary also least in seeking moderation, we should forget to be moderate, and by falling into that fault my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> accounts incident to men who find things better in their <hi>Books</hi> then in the <hi>Practice</hi> be apt <hi>to contend too far to bring things to perfection,</hi> and loose the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings that otherwise might be made. There is this one thing alone I am apt to think might do much. If all <hi>Declarations</hi> that are required to be <hi>Made, Subscribed,</hi> or <hi>Sworn,</hi> were Imposed only as to the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>End,</hi> leaving those who submit to them <hi>free</hi> to the use of their own <hi>Expressions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have now done, after I have given warning that no man presume to take occasion from this Discourse to act any farther in the case of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity then he is fully perswaded in his own mind about it. If he does so, I must protest he hath not me for his Example. I have purposed from my heart for my part, by God's grace, not to stirr a step farther then I find my judgment to go along with me, who though I write liberally in regard to others, and believe that many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and discreet men may take up with it, yet must I be sparing in what I do my self. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, I dare not, but act methinks by the <hi>Peny,</hi> when it is by <hi>Talents</hi> that I speak.

            <p>In the <hi>Act of Ʋniformity,</hi> By the <hi>Declaration of Assent and Consent to all things, and every Thing contained in, and prescribed by the Two Books of Common Prayer, and of Ordering Priests and Deacons,</hi> we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not,<note place="margin">These Materials were provided, during the sitting of that <hi>Parliament</hi> which passed the <hi>Act of Uniformity,</hi> and other the like Rigorous Acts; and are therefore drawn up in the form of an <hi>Explanatory Bill,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was supposed, they were not like to <hi>Repeal</hi> their own Acts, though they might be got to <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret</hi> them. But now we have a New <hi>Parliament,</hi> and that after another also Dissolved, we may expect quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Work: Yet will the Proposing these Things still to view, have their use, both for suppressing such as have said, The <hi>Nonconformists</hi> know not what they would have; and setting some Measure to our own Desires, and the <hi>Parliaments</hi> Condescentions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the same.</note> that these Books are in every Minute parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, infallible, or free from that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which is inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to all Humane Composure: but that they are in the main Contents, to be sincerely appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and used. And we do therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be sufficient, if it be made to the use of the Book, in the <hi>Ordinary Constant Lords Day Service,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing any Exceptions some may have against some Things in the <hi>By-Offices,</hi> and <hi>Occasional Service,</hi> the <hi>Rubrick,</hi> and otherwise. And for the Ceremonies which are made, and have been always, and on all hands, held to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indifferent Things, we think fit that they be left to the Consciences and Prudence of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, and People, every where (excepting
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:206017:90"/> the <hi>Cathedrals</hi>) to use them, or forbear them, as they judge it most meet for their own and others Edification. Provided, that if any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son will have his Child Baptised with the Sign of the <hi>Cross,</hi> or stands upon any thing else, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto required by the Service-Book, if the Minister himself scruple the Performance, he shall permit another to do it.</p>
            <p>In the same <hi>Act,</hi> By those Words in the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,</hi> that <hi>It is not lawful to take Arms against the</hi> King, <hi>upon any Pretence whatsoever;</hi> we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend no new or strange Thing, but the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Maintenance on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>Kings</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority against Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,<note place="margin">That we have our Reason for these Interpretations, any one may see that please in those Arguments against the <hi>Oxford Oath,</hi> and this <hi>Subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> which are offered in a little Book Entituled <hi>The Peaceable Design,</hi> so that we can by no means submit thereto, without them. There is moreover this Clause [<hi>And I will conform to the</hi> Liturgy <hi>of the Church, as it is by Law Establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed</hi>] we desire may be spared, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause upon our Declaration before of <hi>Assent</hi> and <hi>Consent,</hi> (which must be the Bounds of our Sense thereof) it is needless altogether, and can serve but for a Snare only to Mens Consciences.</note> according to the common De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Writers, in the Case of Subjection to Princes. By the Words, <hi>I abhor the Position of taking Arms by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the</hi> King, <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionated by him,</hi> we never thought of Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Arbitrary Commissions of the <hi>King,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Law; but by those <hi>Commissionated by him,</hi> we understand such as are Legally Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missionated,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:206017:91"/> and in the Legal Pursuit of such Commissions. By the Clause which follows, that requires a Renunciation of all <hi>Endeavour of any Alteration of Government in the Church or State,</hi> we never meant to deny any Free-Born Subject his Right, of choosing <hi>Parliament Men</hi> or Acting in his Place for the Common Good any way, according to Law; but that he shall Renounce all such <hi>Endeavour,</hi> as is Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or not warranted by the Constitution of the Nation; and particularly, such an <hi>Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> as was Assumed in the late Times, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and against the Consent of the <hi>King:</hi> And for the rest of the <hi>Subscription,</hi> which is enjoyned but to the Year 1682. Be it ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that it cease presently, and be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger enjoyned.</p>
            <p>And forasmuch as there is an Oath prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and required of all <hi>Non-conformist</hi> Preachers, that Reside in any Corporate-Town, by a certain Act of the former <hi>Parliament,</hi> made at <hi>Oxford</hi> in the 17th. Year of His now Majesties Reign, Entituled, <hi>An Act for restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Non-conformists, <hi>from inhabiting Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> We do fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declare,<note place="margin">This <hi>Oath</hi> is of the same Contents with the <hi>Subscription</hi> before; and to Impose both, is nothing else but the multiplying Wrath, and laying Load on the already Laden.</note> That it shall suffice any Man; for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of his
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:206017:91"/> Free born Liberty, of Inhabiting where he thinks best; and serve him also instead of the fore-mentioned <hi>Subscripton;</hi> to take that <hi>Oath</hi> in this Form of Words following. <hi>I</hi> A.B. <hi>do swear, That I hold it unlawful upon any Pretence, to take Arms against the</hi> King, <hi>his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or Laws: And that I disclaim that dangerous Position, of taking Arms by his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, against his Person, or any Legally Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missionated by him, in the Legal Pursuit of such Commissions: And that I will not endeavour any Alteration of Government in the Church or State, in any way or manner, not warranted by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the Kingdom, or any otherwise than by Act of</hi> Parliament. And as soon as any Man hath taken the <hi>Oath</hi> thus, he shall be dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of all Penalty for his Omission before.</p>
            <p>We do declare moreover, That whereas it is required also in the <hi>Act of Ʋniformity,</hi> that every Minister who enjoys any Living, or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Preferment, shall be Ordained by a Bishop; and there are several persons of late, who in case of Necessity, for want of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops took Presbyterian-Orders: Our Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not in any wise to disgust the Reformed Churches beyond the Seas, and make it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for such to be Re-ordained to the <hi>Office;</hi> but that they receive this Second Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Hands to the <hi>Exercise</hi> of their

            <p>And whereas there is a <hi>Subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> also in the <hi>Canons,</hi> and the <hi>Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal-Oath</hi> of <hi>Obedience,</hi> imposed on most Ministers by the Bishops, that have given some of the greatest Occasion to <hi>Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> heretofore; which yet never passed into Law by any Act of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
               <note place="margin">If the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance</hi> be taken, and the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> subscribed, and the <hi>Declaration</hi> before to the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> made; we see no need of boyling over these three Things again for us, in the <hi>Canons,</hi> unless it be for a <hi>Crambe Repetita,</hi> on purpose to Kill us. Neither do we think the putting any Honest Men who fear <hi>God,</hi> out of the Vineyard, to be so good a Thing for her, that our Wise Church of <hi>England</hi> should use so much Care and Industry as She takes, that She may not miss to do it.</note> We do fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declare, That nothing more of that kind shall be required of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hers hence-forward, then was made and held necessary, by the Act of the <hi>Thirteenth of Elizabeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in regard there hath been great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence taken by Conscientious Ministers, at the Bishops, (or their Courts) commanding them to read the Sentence of Excommunication
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:206017:92"/> against some or other of their Parish, for such Faults as they think not at all worthy of so great a Censure: We declare it but a just Thing,<note place="margin">As we think, there is no <hi>Elder</hi> in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> who is not a <hi>Pastor,</hi> and that there is no <hi>Lay Pastor;</hi> so do we account, that there is no <hi>Pastor</hi> or <hi>Presbyter,</hi> but such as have the Power both to <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Teach,</hi> committed to them by <hi>Christ:</hi> Yet do we for all that, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it not only <hi>Lawful,</hi> but <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient,</hi> for the ordinary Ministers of our <hi>Parochial</hi> Congregations, (when the Church is <hi>National</hi>) to commit part of their Charge, (to wit, that of <hi>Ruling) in Actu Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundo,</hi> to some few among them, who are more Eminently fitted for the Work, (that is, the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) and consequently to the Bishop: So that, if this Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Right of Governing their own Flocks, be but acknowledged to Reside in every <hi>Presbyter,</hi> by granting so much to us as this (and what hath preceded) comes to, we shall be unwilling to fall off from <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> upon the Points of <hi>Ordination</hi> and <hi>Jurisdiction.</hi>
               </note> that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Minister be first satisfyed in the Cause, or else be exempted from the Execution of that Charge; and that the Bishop (or his Court) provide some other person, that is satisfyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, to do it.</p>
            <p>And to the intent, that a free Search after Truth may not be discouraged in the Pursuit of Concord, and many other Scruples avoided upon that Account: We declare, That though an <hi>Authentick</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,<note place="margin">The <hi>Authentick</hi> Interpretation of an Article, is the Meaning of the Major Part of the <hi>Convocation:</hi> A <hi>Doctrinal</hi> Interpretation, is the Meaning of any one of the <hi>Doctors</hi> there present, (and consequently, of any other Learned <hi>Expositor</hi>) who are supposed to have the Liberty to abound in their own Sense, so long as they can agree in the Words of the <hi>Article</hi> Established. And this Clause therefore we put in upon Mature Consideration, in regard more especially to the <hi>Conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Latitudinarians,</hi> (which is a Name abused) who being some <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian,</hi> and some <hi>Calvinian,</hi> cannot otherwise Subscribe the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the same <hi>Theses;</hi> as the <hi>Reader</hi> may see more in such a sort of Book as this, called <hi>The Healing Paper,</hi> out of which this <hi>Bill</hi> for <hi>Union</hi> is Collected.</note> as to the Substance of all Laws, yet in the

            <p>And because the very Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of Bishops, and that Subjection to them which is required by the Constitution of the Realm, is or may be an Hinderance to many sober Ministers, and other <hi>Protestants,</hi> of coming into the Church, who are ready to consent to the Doctrine, but not to the Discipline or Government of it: We do declare, That so long as any Person or Party do acknowledge the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> as <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in this Nation, and obey their Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,<note place="margin">That is, Although there be some that cannot acknowledge our <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan Prelates</hi> to be <hi>Christs Officers,</hi> distinct from the <hi>Elders</hi> in Scripture, Yet so long as they can live Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able lives in Obedience to them, as Ecclesiastical Magistrates under His Majesty, for the keping the several Congregations, in their Precincts, <hi>to that Gospel Order, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves allow, and for super-vising their Constitutions in Things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, that nothing be done, but in Subordination to the Peace of the Kingdom,</hi> (which is a Notion wherein the Judicious of every Party may acquiesce, and expressed by us in these very Words in a Book forenamed) it is suffecient unto National Church Union.</note> or the Bishops, <hi>in Licitis &amp; Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis,</hi> upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>his</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity (committed to them for the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of that External

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:206017:94"/> for their Families, and the Souls of many People are thereby neglected: Be it farther Enacted, That no Clergy-Man for the Three next Years ensuing, be suffered to Enjoy any more than one Living or Cure of Souls,<note place="margin">We propose these Things, we confess, as if we were in <hi>Republica Platonis,</hi> but we should be glad to see any Fruits of this kind, as those who are in <hi>Faece Romuli</hi> may expect.

            <p>And forasmuch, as there are some Ministers of a good Life, that cannot (according to their
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:206017:94"/> Judgments) allow of our Parochial Churches, nor a Book of <hi>Liturgy:</hi> but do choose to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> in the way of their Gathered or Separate Congregations; and crave the Protection and Clemency of the <hi>King,</hi> upon their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance,<note place="margin">There are two Parts of this <hi>Bill;</hi> One for <hi>Concord</hi> or <hi>Coalition</hi> with all such as can joyn in Parochial Communion, in the Clauses before: The other for <hi>Forbearance</hi> of those that cannot, in this last Clause.

            <p>BEcause some will be offended at the <hi>Book,</hi> and others at this <hi>Bill</hi> at the end of it, the Printer shall (having this spare leaf) tell them this Story. A Minister of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> an Ingenious and Considerable person, who lived lately in a Town of good note in the Country, was in the Company of some Gentlemen of that place who were Papists, and he Discoursing occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally about the <hi>Non-Conformists,</hi> they fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighing readily against them, as a Generation not to be suffered to live; and that they wondred that the Episcopal party did not use their Interest to root them out of the Kingdom. These expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions seeming <hi>bitter</hi> to him, as well as <hi>unusu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> (for the Papists ordinarily are more reserved) he could not choose but reflect upon it, and thought in his mind immediately that it would be worth his inquiry to know what the same persons did use to say to the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> of the <hi>Churchmen,</hi> that spake of the <hi>Dissenters</hi> thus to <hi>him,</hi> and going therefore to some of the more eminent of the Town of that perswasion, he desired them to tell him truly what such Gentlemen (naming them by
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:206017:96"/> name) were wont to say of the <hi>Episcopal party</hi> when they were in their Company. They told him they said ordinarily they were men of a Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Spirit, that made not Conscience of their Religion, as the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> did, and consequently deserved to be looked on and dealt with according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or words yet harsher to that effect. Ʋpon this the Minister tells them what those persons said of the <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> party in such Company to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the other day. The good men were astonished at it, in regard of their frequent conversation with them; and the result was, that both they and the Minister concluded streight of what a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous importance the Dissention of the Protestants is amongst us; That the Design and Strength of the Papists lyes there; And what need we have therefore to use all the means, and speed we can, to endeavour a composure and concord one with another.</p>
